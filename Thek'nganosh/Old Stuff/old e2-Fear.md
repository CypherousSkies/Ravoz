`e2` is a regular order-2 directed glyph.
@@nge2 A, B
Read as `A nge2 B` or `B nge2j A` meaning "A is inside B" or "B contains A". By nature of the glyph (with a few exceptions like `nge2`), A must be at least animate.

## Speaking a reversed glyph
Sometimes it's not practical (or otherwise undesirable) to say an `e2` word with the arguments in the "right" order, in which case add a syllable-final `j` (here referring to `ja2` meaning "-1"). For an example, see: [[Misc Graphs#Culture and Myself]].
