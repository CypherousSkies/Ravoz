# [Ouwi](https://ouwi.org/index.html)
### General Thoughts
I love the core premise of Ouwi (pronounced owie) being a collection of 10 stories which define each core character and are just readings of the alphabet. It's adorable. It's got a built-in method of creole, but I would love to see a more fleshed out native lexicon. It's already got spiritual overtones which is really pretty and excellent for what I want. 
That said, it shares many of the problems with [[00 UNLWS|UNLWS]] in that it is criminally underdeveloped and the lack of a renderer makes quick digital texts impossible. It is, however, possible that a renderer would be easier for Ouwi than for UNLWS because of the built-in spoken component (making a parser much easier).
Unfortunately Ouwi is documented in such a way which makes linearity the default and branching patterns a deviation.
### Relationship to [[Thek'nganosh|Thek'nganosh]]
Ouwi's relationship with Thek'ngyanosh is somewhat tenuous.
- I've tried to keep a solid number of the glyphs compatible, but the sound is completely different.
- Additionally, with different stories and consonant inventory, native speech is mutually unintelligible.
- Grammatically, Thek'ngyanosh shares much in common with Ouwi, and any speaker of Ouwi will have no trouble learning Thek'ngyanosh's writing system (though Thek'ngyanosh borrows much from UNLWS as well)
