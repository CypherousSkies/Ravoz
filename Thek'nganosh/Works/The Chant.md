## Text
I'm walking along a dimly lit brutalist corridor with no off-shoots.
At the end of the corridor is the atrium.
At the base of the atrium is a large wooden door, just past the circular insignia which dominates the floor.
Through the door is the pitch-black tunnel.
I walk into the tunnel, passing the 7 figures.
After the figures are the windows.
After the windows is the great tree in the forest.
I fly above the forest, looking for the clearing.
In the clearing is a single white flower.
I touch it and am relaxed.
