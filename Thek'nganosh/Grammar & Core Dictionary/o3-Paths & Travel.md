# Paths (o3)
`o3` is a person-intersecting order-3+n (variadic) directed glyph with two forms:

**Terminator (travel,range):**
@@yo3 A,B,C
Read as `A ngo3: B,C;` or `A ngo3 B tko3 C` meaning "A built C from B" 

**Single Intersection (comparison):** (graph noted as `mo1/ngo3(a,b,c)` or `ngo3(a,b,c,/d);mo1(d)`)
@@'o1 single-intersecting yo3 A,B,C
Read as `A ngo3 'o1: B,C` or `A ngo3 'o1 B tko3 C` meaning "I think that A is between B (which A is most like) and C (which A is least like) in terms of (implicit quality of) location". Note that the glyph intersecting `o3` must be able to "think" about it (so must be a person in this context).

## Variadic extension
If you'd like to say "I went from home to the tree to the meeting hall" you can just add another `o2`-esc leg and extend as usual.
