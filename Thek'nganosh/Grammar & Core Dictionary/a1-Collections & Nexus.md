# Community (a1)
`a1` is an irregular order-2+n (variadic) quasi-directed glyph which has two forms:

**Collection**: (graph noted as `*a1(a,b,c>)`)
@@C <nga1 A,B
Read as `C nga1: A, B;` or `;A, B :nga1j C`  meaning "A and B all together which are C"

**Equivalence**:
@@nga A,B
Read as `nga1: A,B,C` meaning "A,B,C which are a group together"

C | Un-directed Literal | Directed Literal
-|-|-
'| perceive | that which is perceived
m| semantic nexus, and | means/described as
n| some (but not all) of, or | rel
ng| also known/described as, examples of each-other | C is a subset
b| form a whole (e.g. anatomical parts of a body, community) | rel
d| more than its components (e.g. sentence, parts of a personality) | rel
v|
th| causal nexus | causes/leads to
r| spiritually connected, spiritually group (e.g. religion) | believe
rz| work connected | work on
j| be brethren | C is progeny, next generation
sh| mutually trust, community | initiate C, want to trust
z| deeply connected, (close) friend group | have a squish on
l| romantic relationship (love) | be romantically attracted to
y| sexual relationship | be sexually attracted to
g| connected disparately (distributed) | rel
k| connected centrally | control
h| convey information to each-other, dialogue | speak/write at/about
x| convey stuff to each-other, share | give gift
(tk)| reflexive marker

## Variadic case
Feel free to add as many directed and undirected branches from the 'core' circle as necessary. This can side-step some annoying binary composition problems, though it may still be desirable to still use many `a1`s to emphasize the size and order of a group.
### Spoken
In the interest of brevity when speaking: say the kind of list, then the list of members (e.g. `ta1: ga2, ka2, ha2; ...` meaning "ga2, ka2, and ha2, which are part of a whole"). It's also acceptable to say the list kind at the end of the members, but this should be used sparingly, usually definitially or poetically (e.g. `ke1mjo3tk, ra3tdo2tk, 'o1, ma1 (nge1 ga2) ...` meaning "Kemjok, Ratdok, and I, we ...").

## Speaking cyclic expressions
Sometimes, you might end up with a cycle enclosed by a pair of `a1` words. This can either be said directly (e.g. `... 'a1 ..., ... 'a1`) or be said with a syllable-final sound noting the number of branches are grouped by this `a1` word in the cycle (of the form `*a1#`), transliterated with grouping symbols as appropriate (e.g. `'a1ng ..., ..., [nga1n ..., ...]`). If you don't immediately know how many you'll be using `n` is fine, though `l` is probably better. For an example, see: [[Misc Graphs#Culture and Myself]].

## Groups with implied members, pronouns
For groups which have unspecified members or quantities of members, say `*a1tk` optionally followed by a [[a2-Spoken-only & line decorations|number, plural, pronoun,]] or [[a3-Unknowns|question]].
(Because of the syllable-final `tk` these are irregular constructions, but I think they're special enough to warrant these)
- If a number or plural is specified and at least one other member is named (e.g. `ma1tk ma2: to1;` meaning "The woman and one other person") then the group contains the specified member and the specified amount of others.
- If a pronoun is specified (e.g. `ma1tk ga2: to1;` meaning "The woman and `ga2`"), it binds as usual, but follows this construction.
- If a question is specified (e.g. `ma1tk na3: to1;` meaning "The woman and who (plural) else?" or "The woman and some other people, who I don't know (the number of),"), then the question binds as if it were a ordinary argument.

And as usual, you can feel free to drop the `tk` and replace it with approximate number (e.g. `ma2` through `tha2`, `ra2`, `rza2g`), plural, or pronoun consonant (e.g. `ma1m: to1;` meaning "The woman and one other person") if you feel like compressing words.

## Cartouches
[[04 Cartouches|UNLWS]] has the right idea when grouping a graph with a cartouche. In speech this can be achieved by grouping a (part of) a sentence with `tka1p` or `tak1 pa2` (e.g. `G, tka1g, ..., ga2 ...` meaning "G, which together we'll call `ga2`, ..., the graph `ga2` is ...").
