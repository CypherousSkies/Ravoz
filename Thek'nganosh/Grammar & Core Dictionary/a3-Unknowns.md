# Unknowns (a3)
`a3` is a person-intersecting order-1 terminator which takes two forms:

**No Intersection (Implicit):**
@@da3 A
Read as `A da3` or `da3 A` (whichever is more convenient) meaning "What (object) is A?" or "A which is some (unknown to me) object". Note that the author is presumed to be the asker in this situation when not marked.

**Single Intersection (Explicit):** @@I don't really like this usage, but I'm not sure how to forgo it? maybe just use irrealis? or! make a way to support counterfactual cartouches from different points of view!
@@ngo3 single intersecting da3 A
Read as `ngo1 da3 A` or `A da3 ngo1` (as above) meaning "You don't know A" or "A is some (unknown to you) object". Note that the glyph intersecting `a3` must be able to "wonder" about it (so must be a person in this context).

No story can be written of this vowel as each word forms a question, though it's still prudent to include it for the purposes of dictionary.
(As a note, the title is chosen in opposition to [[Thek'nganosh/Ouwi]]'s comparable story "Unknown" to accentuate the fact that this story is not only unknown but also *not possible* to know)

(tk)| which branch?

## Person-animate-inanimate-enigmatic distinction
Broadly, an animate object is something can do something. So a mug is animate (it holds water) but a couch is inanimate (things sit on it).
A person is then something that can do something *with intent*. So a cat is a person in this way (a cat can mean to push a mug off the table), but an oven is not (it must operate on someone else's authority, not its own).
To sidestep the inevitable conversation of free will, it's fair to assume that if it can do something without input from another person, it's a person -- the main exception being that abstractions (cultures, governments, etc.) are always at most animate.
In an interesting turn of events, this also means that some objects are *sometimes* people: like a computer suddenly doing its own thing is a person, but when being used to write, it's just animate.
The enigmatic category is somewhat less tangible. Something is enigmatic if there is either no clear way to place it into the former categories (even as a passing member) or assigning person-esc agency would be reductive (e.g. a god). As with person-hood, something can be given enigmatic status only in certain contexts; for example, the Sun, when being referred to in a cosmic sense is enigmatic (solar flares are unpredictable, it may grow hotter or colder on inhumanly long timescales or on an unknowable whim), but as a part of the sky (e.g. the day-night cycle) is animate.
Is that complicated? Yes. But hopefully it leads to interesting features.

## Asking Questions
Saying an `a3` word alone is not enough to emphasize a question, as it only marks an unknown (e.g. someone), so to give it that extra push, combine it with a `za2` (see [[a2-Spoken-only & line decorations#Modality|a2 > Modality]]). The position of `za2` defines what is being asked -- e.g.  `ngo1 za2 ne1 ma3?` (meaning "Do(n't) you trust anyone?") vs `ngo1 ne1 za2 ma3?` ("Who do you trust?"). Note that in transliterations, the question mark is vestigial and is only useful to emphasize the difference between a question which is stated vs a question asked.

## Which Branch?
When asking about which branch can also be followed by a pronoun to mean "What was \<pronoun\>?" or "You meant to come back to \<pronoun\> but didn't, what was it meant to be?"
