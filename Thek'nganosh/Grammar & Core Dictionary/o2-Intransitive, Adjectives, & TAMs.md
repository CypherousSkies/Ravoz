## Conjugation
These can be written either the [[05 Tense, Aspect, Modality#Tense Aspect|UNLWS]] way (with an `'o2` marked with the UNLWS tense marker) or the [[Ouwi]] way (an `o2` word double intersecting).
Most verbs should be left unmarked (for convenience), letting tense be inferred from context.
By default, all verbs are understood to mean now (at time of speaking or writing).
If conjugating the UNLWS way, either include the marking on the "root" (where the consonant particle goes) or off the point of a DI `'o2`.
## Parenthetical Expressions
Need to group some words together, like a sequence of `o2` words or a phrase which might not parse correctly otherwise? Throw a `tko2` at the start of the expression and `tko2tk` at the end of it.
