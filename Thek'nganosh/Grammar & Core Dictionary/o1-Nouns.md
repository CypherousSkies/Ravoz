## A Note on Possession
While a common feature of natural languages, I have complex feelings about the nature of possession. I think of possession here to be a more transient feature, in the same vein as [[e2-Particles & Decorations#Person-animate-inanimate-enigmatic distinction|animacy]], e.g. this is my book right now, but in your hands it is yours. In most cases a directed relationship will be more accurate (e.g. instead of saying "that's my book", say "I really value that book").
For things that whose possession is less material -- e.g. thoughts -- use directed relations (e.g. "My thoughts are that A rel B" would be `A mo1 de3 B`), where "ownership" is instead active participation.
If, for some reason, you absolutely *need* possession, you can single-intersect the possessed as if the word was an `o2` glyph (saying it the same as a SI `o2`).

## Name pronouns
Instead of he/she/they/etc., `tko1` exists to stand in where appropriate. If it's ambiguous who `tko1` refers to, add a consonant from their name (usually the most common, but whatever is distinguishing): e.g. I might refer to `ra3tdo2tk`  as `tko1r` or `tko1d`.
