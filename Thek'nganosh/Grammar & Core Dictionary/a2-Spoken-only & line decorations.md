## Pronouns
Pronouns are a spoken feature of the language, usually used when [[#Branching]], though also appearing when making [[e2-Particles & Decorations#Cartouches|cartouches]]. These aren't pronouns in the usual sense of he/she/they but more as stand-ins for branches, glyphs, or graphs which will be difficult to come back to otherwise.
When using a pronoun referring to a person, instead use `tko1p` or `tko1f` where `f` is a prominent consonant in their name.

### More Pronouns
If more pronouns are needed, any of the pronoun sounds can take number arguments (e.g. `ga2m`, `ga2n`, etc., as in $g_1$,$g_2$, etc.) giving a total of `ta2t` (24) pronouns.

If, for some reason you *still* need more, you can end pronouns with other pronoun consonants (although you might get docked points when talking meta-gramatically as `ga2g`, `ga2k`, etc. can mean "any of the pronouns `ga2'` through `ga2th`") for an additional `tha2` (6) pronouns, giving a total of `ta2d` (30) pronouns.

If you *still* need more, (and want to get into *more* trouble) you can use the [[#Large numbers]] construction of `ga2tk ka2` where `ka2` is a number, which should give you as many pronouns as you need (at the risk of sounding silly).

## Modality
Modalities are interrupting modifications on a relation. Their placement follows in the reading-order of the interruption: so `'o1 me1 ja2 ngo1` (meaning "I love you but you don't love me") would be written `'o1-me1-/-ngo1`; `'o1 ja2 me1 ngo1` (meaning "I don't love you, but you love me") would be written `'o1-/-me1-ngo1`; and `'o1 ja2 me1 ja2 ngo1` (meaning you and I don't love each-other) would be written `'o1-/-me1-/-ngo1`.
The same rules apply for `za2` -- which replacing `ja2` with `za2` in the previous examples, the phrases would translate to: "I love you but do you love me?" or "I love you but I'm not sure if you love me"; "I'm not sure if I love you, but you love me"; and "I'm not sure if we love each-other", the last of which calls the glyph `me1` into question more than how much it applies to each participant.
### Negation
When speaking, negate a verb with `ja2` immediately after it (as with SI [[o2-Intransitive, Adjectives, & TAMs|o2]] glyphs, e.g. `'o1 ja2 nge1 ngo1` means "You and I don't share a name"). You can also negate other glyphs by preceding them with `ja2` (e.g. `'o1 'nge2 ja2 ta1tk` means "I am not (no longer) part of the whole (community, everything)")
### Irrealis
To follow UNLWS's example, [[05 Tense, Aspect, Modality|irrealis]] is written as a (directed) gap (- - or -' -) and said as `za2` or `za2j` and is used as above. This is used to distinguish possible [[e3-Color and Intensity#Counterfactual Cartouches|worlds]] from each-other and is most notably used when grouping/comparing [[e2-Particles & Decorations#Cartouches|cartouches]]. This isn't a critical feature of the language, as it is mostly covered by [[a3-Unknowns|a3]] words, but it's a nice one to borrow for brevity or conveying uncertainty.
## Numbers
Numbers are a special kind of adjective which are said after the word they're modifying as usual. The UNLWS system for [[Numbers]] is used here with the default base being 6. Somewhat idiosyncratically, numbers are said smallest (non-fractional) part said first, with the second sexit's consonant stuck to the end of the syllable, then the next two sexits and so forth, ending with the seximal point marker then saying the $6^{-1}$ and  $6^{-2}$ term together (as $6^{-1}$`a2`$6^{-2}$), and so forth.
The following are some instructive examples:

number(b\[2\*5\]) | spoken (en) | symbol
-|-|-
11 (7) | `ma2m` (onesy one/seven) |
24 (16) | `tha2n` (twosy four) |
103 (39) | `nga2 rza2n` (nif three) | 
1223 | `nga2n rza2n na2m` (onesy two nif twosy three) |
1.3 (1.5) | `ma2 sha2 nga2` (one point three) | 
1.13 (1.25) | `ma2 sha2 ma2ng` (one point one three) |

### Large numbers
After $6^6$ (46,656), the `rza2g` system breaks down. Then say `rza2tk ga2` where `ga2` is the number for the exponent. Is it clunky? yes. Will you need exact numbers that big? probably not when spoken (see [[#Orders of magnitude approximates]]).

### Orders of magnitude, approximates
Pronoun sounds can fill generic spots, e.g. `ga2m` means "somewhere between `tha2` and `ra2`". Similarly `rza2g` means some power of `tha2`. Saying `ya2 rza2g` means "on the order of $6^{g}$".
## Branching
When noting a branch, you'll usually say a word starting with `tk`. For a generic branch, it's acceptable to say `tka2 pa2`, though your audience would probably appreciate knowing what kind, which is said `tka2 'ip` (in the usual [[Thek'nganosh#Transliterations|shorthand]]).

Usually, if you plan to come back to a branch, you follow it with a pronoun (e.g. `tka2 'a1g` or `tka2 ga2`) which you'd come back to by saying the pronoun with a syllable-final `tk` (e.g. `ga2tk`).
If you don't feel like spending the time to specify the vowel, it's also acceptable to say `tka2p` and returning as usual.

If you don't intend to return to a branch, note that with a syllable-final `tk` (e.g. `tka2 'a1tk`, think of it like parentheses closing off).
Again, if you feel like being very brief, you could say something like `tka2tk` , which would close off any branching that might happen.

### Re-opening a branch
In conversation, you might want to re-open a branch that was already closed off. This can either be done with [[e2-Particles & Decorations#Cartouches|cartouches]] prefaced with a summary of what is to be reopened, or by the same sort of summary followed by `tka2tk pa2tk`.
