# Reflexive, Directed (e1)
`e1` is a regular, inanimate-preserving order-2 quasi-directed glyph with two forms:

**Symmetrical:** (reflexive)
@@nae1 A, B
Read as `A nge1 B` or `B nge1 A` (both are fully equivalent) which means "A which is also called B". A and B can be swapped without any loss of information, although if either is inanimate, both must be.

**Pointed:** (graph noted as `nge1(a,b>)`)
@@nge2 A, B
Read as `A nge1n B` or `B nge1j A` meaning "A is inside B" or "B contains A". By nature of the glyph (with a few exceptions), A must be at least animate.

## Speaking a reversed glyph
Sometimes it's not practical (or otherwise undesirable) to say a directed `e1` word with the arguments in the "right" order, in which case add a syllable-final `j` (here referring to `ja2` meaning "-1"). For an example, see: [[Misc Graphs#Culture and Myself]].
