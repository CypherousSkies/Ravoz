discord intro draft
>hi everyone! i'm sky (or whatever other substring of my username you like), they/them pronouns), i've been vaguely toying with the idea of learning TNIL for a little bit now and i guess this is me committing to making an effort lol
i've been hanging around the edge of the conlangoverse for years now and just decided to dive in with some of the more unique ones (toki pona, Unker Non-Linear Writing System, etc.) and one does not travel around long in that company without running into Ithkuil. I'm particularly interested in the non-linear aspects of the language, which of course leads my interest to the cartouche script.

## General Thoughts
Honestly, I respect Ithkuil's devotion to absurd precision. I think it's antithetical to what I'm doing here, but is definitely something worth thinking about as a computer language as computers can reliably decode sentences. It would be kinda cool if there was an Ithkuil Oracle-type machine — something which told you the state of a complex situation in a vague, yet highly information-dense way. Now that I've typed that out, I see that what I want is an AI who summarizes text in Ithkuil, perhaps as a form of fine-tuned BART or T5 algorithm. Whatever the case, it would be easier to train than a natural language, given that outputs are within a machine-interpretable format, and with community translations it shouldn't be difficult to get training data.

### Kitchen Sink Polysynthesis
I'd like to steal some of the polysynthesis vibes Ithkuil has to make my life a little easier in the direction of [[The Rāvòzò'ádi Project]].

### Writing System
I'd like to make a fully non-linear script for this language with their help. It would be kinda fun to have as a [[Thek'nganosh]]-adjacent system for extremely complex garden segments. Unfortunately it looks like the [cartouche-script](https://ithkuil.place/mirror/2004-en/Chapter_11.htm) (their non-linear system) is on indefinite hiatus, so unless I do it myself, it's not happening. Update: it is happening, just unofficially.
