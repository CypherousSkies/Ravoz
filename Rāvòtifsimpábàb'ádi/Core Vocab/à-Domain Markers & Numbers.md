These decorations represent [[Line Decorations#Domain Emblems|domain markers]] and numbers! If it's marked (with a `b`-esc loop above the line, said with a syllable final `b`), then it becomes a relation with an action (with the exception of `bà` and `dà` which just have different presentations).

Each of these is written differently:
numbers are written the [[Numbers|UNLWS]] way

## Numbers
Hey so numbers are a thing. They're a special kind of [[o-Adjectives & Conjugation|adjective]] which can be animated to act as multiplication. In general, multiplication is the default as in spoken settings, making working logarithmically easiest.
For numbers smaller than what would be called `ŋà`, you can either use base six or multiplicative notation.
I don't really like quantified measure words, but I also do need some numbers sometimes.
### Plural and grammatical number
If something is not marked for number, it does not have a number. So if I write `má` am I talking about one entity or six or a thousand? It doesn't matter. All that matters is that that is a particular instance of an unspecified number of things of the same type. As with temporal conjugation, there is no default anchor quantity. Does this mean you can usually assume that it's one thing? Yeah. Will it stop me when I suddenly assert that the one thing in the text is actually a group of a hundred similar things? No.
### Ordinals
Say like arabic numerals (e.g. 23b6 is said `xàbšàžà`) with the tones on the numbers following `xàb` being unimportant (and thus largely free) as it is unambiguous that you're talking about a number. If you want to get spicy about it, you could use the tones to indicate the change between sexits but that's not required.
### Numbering words
So I have `má`. If there are two of them I can say it as `mášà` (written as `máo` with a UNLWS 2 below the non-intersecting arm of the `o`). If there are a bunch I can say `mánà` (written as `má` with the UNLWS plural ligature going out). If I mean the *first* of them, I can say `fàmá` (written like `má ì'om` with a single dot in the triangle of the `ì`).
There is a fourth case (the corollary of the plural case) which is `mášàb` (written as `má` with UNLWS 2 under the outgoing line, with active dot), but I'm not really sure when you'd use this (this is a holdover from early in the language's development where I really wanted the tables to fill themselves out nicely). If you drop the dot, it reads as `mášà` but with a more active emphasis on the number (as in the "exactly two of us went there, and one more arrived later).
### Writing Non-trivial operations (like addition)
This number system is entirely based on UNLWS and is beholden to its quirks. I could go about documenting it, but the folks over on the UNLWS have already done a better job.
