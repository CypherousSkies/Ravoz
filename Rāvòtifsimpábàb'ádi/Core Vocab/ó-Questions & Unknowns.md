`ó` words are, by themselves, just unknowns; lacking the power of a question and more akin to words like "someone". To give them the power of a question, combine it with an [[i-Animacy & Certainty|irrealis]] gap/particle at the point of uncertainty (e.g. "Is there anyone you trust?" vs "Who do you trust?"). There are two ways to answer a question: with a rel-gap (`-( )-`, said `óg`), meaning something like "a possible answer to `ó` might be" or "one such `ó` thing is"; or with a line connecting them (`-(-)-`, said `ók`) which means something like "*the* answer is" or "the particular thing which satisfies this is".
