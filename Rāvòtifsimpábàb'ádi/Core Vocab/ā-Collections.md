`ā` words are order 2+ relations, generally representing collections and their actions. Undirected relations stemming from an `ā` glyph are actions upon the whole collection. The directed part can be inferred by word order (\<undirected parts\> \*ā \<directed parts\>), which can be reversed (\<directed parts\> \*āg \<undirected parts\>). Terminators are marked with syllable-final `f`. This relation has two presentations, each with some nuances:

**Semi-directed Relation**:
`>o>-` The directed and directed components are glossed separately, despite them sharing space, defining different relationships among groups.

**Terminator**:
`o>-` Essentially the terminator version of the relation, distinct from `á` words, generally representing the noun form of these relationships (e.g. lover).

## xā: The Cartesian Product
I'm borrowing this from math as it's useful for making shapes with a small number of words. I think it's best illustrated by some examples (X is the Cartesian product):
- Circle X Line = Cylinder (extrude the circle along the line)
- Circle X Circle = Torus = Doughnut (extrude the circle along the circle)
- Line X Line = rectangle
- Hexagon X Line = hexagonal prism (same as cylinder)
- Rectangle X Line = rectangular prism (if the rectangle is curved, this may result in a twisting thing)
An unfortunate side-effect is that (without further specification), the extrusion is at a right angle from the other things. Specify this with ŋō\*à'o where \* is some angular distance (see [[ō-Paths#Natural Rotational Units]]).
