This particle details through which medium something happened; usually marked by [[à-Domain Markers & Numbers|range domain]].
I'm glossing these by their [[à-Domain Markers & Numbers|range domains]] as that's the key distinction in meaning. As with all particles, they are used as terminators and inter-relational glyphs with hopefully natural meanings.

## Optional written morphology
Taking a note from [[Terminators#Emotions|UNLWS]]'s emotion words, one can vary the tightness/depth curl `a` words to increase the activity? importance? intensity of a word (which would be reduplicated in spoken). For example something that is very bright could be written with a tight `zaf` and be said as `zazaf`.
