## Compositional Categories
One can construct "families" of things by ascribing what they are animated/controlled by. These may be applied as decorations as would any animacy category; and may be constructed as cartouches.

- Mushroom is "Land animate" (`sá div`)
- Plant is "Sun animate" (`ríbà zapà div`)
- Herbivore is "Plant animate" (`ríbàzapàdi div` or `nábi div`)
- Carnivore is "animate (reflexive)" (`bòdiv`)
- Omnivore is "Plant, reflexive animate" (`ríbàzapàdi ā bò div` or `nábi ā bò div`)
- Computer is "Thinking-being compute animate" (`pápadiv`)
- All Ideas are animate 

## Causation & Intention
I don't like time. It's silly. I don't really like causation. It's very linear language. Unfortunately I have trouble making myself use other words. So. Here's a quick primer on what word to use for what kinds of causation and where instead to use intent words.
### ŋiv: explanation/situational causality
If your causation is the answer to a "why" question, then this is a good option. For example: "Being tired makes me sad" could be translated as `rìpi žatà gàbví nomimŋiv rìpi kofa` (roughly: "Me sometimes not being energetic (by internal sense) is an explanation for the fact that I feel sad", see [[Grammar#*(i a)m *(i a)v Construction]] for how `nomimŋiv` is interpreted).
### div: mechanical intent/procedural causality
This is for situations like "pushing buttons makes words appear" (`naf zō nó dim gítàb`) and "submitting the necessary paperwork makes me a notary". Laws of physics, knowable processes, and ideological functions fit into this category of causality.
### piv: personal intent
Similarly to `div`, this is for situations like "I can make you understand a story" (`rì dopiv lì(mi) nī dá`; the `mi` isn't strictly necessary here, but I like having some redundancy for `dov`). So things where you intend and (usually) cause something.
### tiv: incomprehensible intent/causation without reason
This is both "God wills it" and "there is no way that was supposed to work". *Usually* this will be used as a particle, but in some cases it's a nice thing to have, e.g. `rìbi fádi tiv zapà fížatàpi` (roughly: "the functional physicality of my body makes seeing painful for some indiscernible reason").
### niv: generic causality
If it's not an explanation and can't be broken into a different kind of causation, you can use `niv`. It's easy and can be qualified later with particle versions of the above (this is to support UNLWS causality) but I'd advise against it generally; the purpose of much of this language is to make me think more carefully about things and `niv` is an easy way to not explain what I mean when I say that A causes B.
## Person-animate-inanimate-enigmatic distinction (Animacy)
Animacy is a property of nouns and collections, and like all properties is not intrinsic.

Broadly, an animate object is something can do something, while inanimate objects are things that things happen to. So a mug is animate (it holds water) but a couch is inanimate (things sit on it). 

A person is then something that can do something *with intent*. So a cat is a person in this way (a cat can mean to push a mug off the table), but an oven is not (it must operate on someone else's authority, not its own).

To sidestep the inevitable conversation of free will, it's fair to assume that if it can do something without input from another person, it's a person — the main exception being that abstractions (cultures, governments, etc.) are always at most animate as they are ultimately tools for the people they represent/service.
In an interesting turn of events, this also means that some objects are *sometimes* people: like a computer suddenly doing its own thing is a person, but when being used to write, it's just animate.

The enigmatic category is somewhat less tangible. Something is enigmatic if there is either no clear way to place it into the former categories (even as a passing member) or assigning person-esc agency would be reductive (e.g. a god). As with person-hood, something can be given enigmatic status only in certain contexts; for example, the Sun, when being referred to in a cosmic sense is enigmatic (solar flares are unpredictable, it may grow hotter or colder on inhumanly long timescales or on an unknowable whim), but as a part of the sky (e.g. the day-night cycle) is animate.

### Grammatical Implications of Animacy
Action is usually implied to flow from more animate to less. This is most notable in the case of `ī` words, as it is grammatically equivalent to say `* *ī *bi` and `* *īn *bi`, as the inanimate marking indicates it as not reciprocating. While less grammatically notable in the other cases, this is a useful model. For example, let's imagine that a camera (`zí'or zaf`, you (`lì`), and I (`rì`) watch a building (`ŋádi`). While it's completely valid to say `rì vò lì vò zí'or zaf rā ŋádi`, one can use animacy to add nuance to the situation. Perhaps I'm doing a stake-out and by contrast, you just happened to look at it for a while to appreciate its architecture, then it might make sense to say `rìpi vò zí'or zafdi vò lìbi rā ŋádi`; implying a certain amount of activity on my part, a control on the camera's part, and an incidental nature on your part.

### An Analysis from a Semiotics Perspective Because I'm Like This
I also roughly mean to use animacy as a native expression what kinds of *signs* you mean when talking about something. (for this analysis, it's useful to think of animacy as a sliding scale or ranks, but keep in mind that's not the only way to conceptualize it, and that there may be cases in which the sliding scale interpretation is especially unhelpful)

So, for a variation on a classic example, consider a painting of a person, let's call them Alice. I cannot have a conversation with this version of Alice, neither can do much of anything other than simply exist (*ceci n'est pas Alice* as it were). However, it is natural to look at the painting of Alice and say, "that's Alice" (the *signifier*) and for the listener to infer that the person called Alice looks like the painting (that which is *signified*). For some words to over-define this phenomenon, we can say that the painting of Alice is *iconic* (a representation), the name Alice is *symbolic* (connected to the signified through abstractions), and a person pointing at a person and saying "that's Alice" is an *indexical* (like pointing with your index finger).

Ok so how does all this have to do with animacy and why even write this section? Well first of all it's my language I can be stupid about stuff that I half-remember all day if I want to, and second, because it's a useful framework for explaining when things might change animacy. For example, pointing at the painting, someone might say `ìlīsibi hī xòdi` (`hī` here technically optional, but it does add some flavor that I like and adds a layer of grammatical redundancy that I happen to like when speaking) to signify that this is an iconic (inanimate) signifier of Alice (`ìlīsi'i`). Similarly, if someone were to point at a game representation (e.g. a dog in Monopoly or a screen name) of Alice, they might say `ìlīsidi hī xòdi` to signify that this is a symbolic (animate) signifier of them. Finally, pointing at Alice themself, someone might say `ìlīsipi hī xòdi` signifying an idexical (person) representation of Alice.

In addition to symbolic signs, 'animate' may also be used for the iconic signs which are interactive or used as proxies to talk about them (like a video or the idea of Alice that their friends imagine when thinking about them). Relatedly, 'person' is not confined to indexical signs, but also when discussing the extra-textual, non-tool symbol of Alice. Additionally, 'inanimate' can be used when referring to the body of Alice (which may be indexical in context) or the concept/nature of the name "Alice" (which would be symbolic).

The same basic process applies for less animate things too. So if we're instead talking about some freshwater (`ŋídi`), which is indexically animate, then a painting of that water (`táŋíxòdi`, `xò` here acting as an adjective) would be iconically inanimate. Likewise, the symbol `ŋíxò` is still animate when using it to talk about the signified water, but is often inanimate when referring to the abstract concept of the water (e.g. in how it relates to the water cycle).

As far as I know, there isn't a semiotic theory for describing brushes with the truly unknowable ('enigmatic' entities), as the idea somewhat runs counter to the whole analysis (see 5 below). That is not to say, however that it doesn't help to attempt to apply it anyway. For example, when talking about a god, let's say Aphrodite, being able to point at her manifestation might lead someone to use 'person' animacy, even though the manifestation is a sign of something greater. In lieu of making a whole theory of semiotics to include the enigmatic, I will simply leave it at that, and allow you to come to your own conclusions for what signs might be enigmatic. I'm not sure that there is any perceptible sign that something is truly unknowable or otherwise enigmatic (as to perceive it, in a sense, is to 'know' some part of it) other than a) not knowing what/how/why it is, b) an active subversion of expectation in a hitherto inexpiable way, or c) vibes, but again, I'll chalk this up to my small-mindedness. 

#### Related Half-Thoughts Which May or May Not Help
1. Abrahamic tradition would probably point out that belief can act as a useful sign for enigmatic entities, which makes sense, but I'm not sure I completely vibe with that as a critical point to signifying the enigmatic. Having just tried, I'm not sure I can put into words why I'm not happy with this as an analysis. It might be that I'm not a fan of the centering of the concept of belief as a necessary condition for being enigmatic, it might be that my concept of the enigmatic is more informed by existential horror than theology; whatever the case, I'm not sure I can do this analysis justice without a bunch of research and thought which is well outside my current scope for this topic.
2. To steal someone else's ideas on this topic, in *Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance*, Robert Pirsig makes the analysis that ghosts (which, I would say, are by their nature somewhat enigmatic, though ghosts as not-quite-thinking beings of purpose might be better classified as animate) and the laws of physics (which are by their nature at most animate as they are knowable and abstractions) are in the same sort of class of things which both must always have existed in some sense, and in another sense plainly cannot have existed before they were "invented." Whether this means that one should decide then that all things that are primarily signified by belief are enigmatic, or that all things primarily signified by belief are at most animate is, I think is a paradox whose resolution comes down to personal taste and discretion. Again, I'm not sure I fully vibe with this analysis as it applies to animacy as it feels overly-reductive, and at the end of the day I still believe that 'enigmatic' is still a useful category beyond the concepts of invention and belief, but I'm not sure I could satisfactorily put into words why I think that.
3. A note on the usage of `hò/xò` in signs: this is a speech/linear-specific idea which should be represented by pronouns or just connecting to the relevant glyph in non-linear writing. I can't think of a case where using `hò/xò`/pronouns would change the animacy of the signified except in the case of being a symbol.
4. I can't think of a case when something exceeds its indexical animacy, but that's more likely a result of my own small-mindedness than a hard and fast rule. I'm sure there's a lot of analysis that could be done to this idea, but I'm really not sure where to go with it I'm afraid. It feels like the kind of question that I should have a conditional yes-or-no answer to, but I also don't have the words to describe those conditions.
5. In several parts of this analysis I use unknowability as a metric for enigmatic-ness, but I'm not completely sure that's a necessary property for all enigmatic entities. As with my earlier example, I'd consider the Sun to be an enigmatic entity, and the Sun is, in many ways knowable. I can perceive it, it can be measured, analyzed, broken down and simplified, modeled, and predicted, but all these attempts to make it small fail to grasp the shear unimaginable scales and wonder (with a healthy stab of horror) which I feel whenever I think too long about it. As discussed in [[ì-Pronouns#You and your soul]], I feel kinda the same way about souls: purely practically, they're some property which feels critical to a certain sense of self which in a way feels quantifiable as an emergent property of our bodies, but when I think about it for too long, it feels like looking into the sun; beautiful and occasionally very informative, but the after-effects are not always pleasant (see the Jacob Geller video essay *Head Transplants and the Non-Existence of the Soul* for a well-worded analysis of that unpleasant feeling).
6. Relatedly, self-image and notions of the Self have interesting problems in Ravoz. If I were to talk about my self-image, I'd use `rìdi` in the same way as I'd use `rìdi` to talk about my author-self (see [[á-Nouns#Author/Me distinction]]) despite how they differ. I suppose I could say `rìzībòdi` for self-image, to distinguish from my author-self, but that feels like a trick to get around a deeper issue. The larger problem of the Self is that my self-image is only an approximation of my Self (`rìpi`), though the relationship is cyclical and fairly complicated.
7. As an aside, I also believe that we can exist in a post-self way (I'm still figuring my thoughts out on that one, but the general idea is being able to exist in a way without the separation of Self and Other), but I have no idea how to really communicate that in Ravoz. Perhaps using `řìpi` as a replacement for `rìpi` in that case? It's possible that this concept is not easily expressible in Ravoz, though I'm sure with liberal application of `zò`, it could be made an ordinary part of the language.
