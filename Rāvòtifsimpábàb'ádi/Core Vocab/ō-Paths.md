This relation is order 2+, generally representing comparisons and journeys.

@@Loop for journeys, hourglass for comparison, multiple zigzags for multiple dimensions

Journeys (written with a loop) has no syllable-final consonant (except in suffixes, in which case use an `h`), comparison (written with an hourglass) `x`, units (written with a dash above either an hourglass or loop and without any "destination" points) are a final `f`

## Direction, Coordinate systems, and You('ìpi)
Direction is a difficult concept and I'm going to make as little effort as possible to make something that works in most cases. Here's some things to keep in mind:
1. Everything is relative! Not just in a physics way, but in a useful-talking way! 
2. Left & right are hard
3. Rectilinear coordinate systems (x-y planes) don't work everywhere (i mean look at map projections)
4. Distance + rotation (polar coordinates) always\* work  and are simple to keep track of (just remember the left hand rule and you're good)
So! Use the left hand rule when dealing with rotations (so right is `nōf` and left is `gànōf`, down is `nōf`, up is `gànōf`), and the rest are, I think fairly clear (e.g. away from you is `mōf` and towards you is `gàmōf`). As a note, ranges that are not directions do not necessarily have canonical "directions" (e.g. warm is `gōf`, but what would `kōf` mean?).

\* technically it's geodesic polar coordinates that work for all manifolds, which is locally the same, one just has to be careful about where things fly off to.

## Units & Measurement
Along the unit line attached to the path glyph, one can specify how many and what kind of units are being measured. If no unit is specified, then whatever natural units fit are used. To specify a unit, attach the name/description of it at the end of the unit line. To specify the amount add a number to the side of the unit line.

### Natural Rotational Units
I don't like measurement, but it is useful. So, instead of degrees or radians, I propose hands. As justification, most arms are 3 hands long, and a splayed hand is about as wide as it is tall, so the angular width/height of a splayed hand at arm's length is vaguely constant for most people.

## Talking About Time (Travel)
So you want to talk about time travel (or just the passage of time i guess). I'm going to distinguish some notions of time here, to provide some axes to make them more understandable.
1. Causal time (`nōni`) or "time as the stone falls" (`nōfni ŋimhīmiv mábisá nō šo sò žo`) is the time which the sun and clocks give us. When you are thinking of "linear" time, this is probably what you mean.
2. Branching time (`ŋōni`) or "time as the river flows" (`ŋōfni ŋimhīmiv ŋísá pō so sò zo`) is the dimension of time which the many worlds hypothesis gives us, or more usually, time branching time of choice.
3. Experiential time (`mōsiŋi`) or "time as memory is woven" (`mōfsiŋi ŋimhīmiv báva zō ní`) is the feeling of time passing with your now at the center of it. There is no obligation for this to be linear, but that's what multi-dimensional range construction is for.
These are just the ones I'm going to canonize, but I'm sure you can think of other compositional time-expressions to satisfy your needs, and I encourage you to use them.

## Comparison direction
*Usually*, a range will be expressed with some direction (e.g. doesn't end in an `ō` word) and should be read as travelling in the order the zigzags present. \[TODO: Finish this part because i think i need to think about this\]
