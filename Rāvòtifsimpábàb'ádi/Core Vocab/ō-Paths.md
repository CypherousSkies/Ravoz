This relation is order 2+, generally representing comparisons and journeys.

@@Loop for journeys, hourglass for comparison

Journeys (written with a loop) has no syllable-final consonant (except in suffixes, in which case use an `h`), comparison (written with an hourglass) `x`, units (written with a dash above either an hourglass or loop and without any "destination" points) are a final `f`

## Direction, Coordinate systems, and You('ìpi)
Direction is a difficult concept and I'm going to make as little effort as possible to make something that works in most cases. Here's some things to keep in mind:
1. Everything is relative! Not just in a physics way, but in a useful-talking way! 
2. Left & right are hard
3. Rectilinear coordinate systems (x-y planes) don't work everywhere (i mean look at map projections)
4. Distance + rotation (polar coordinates) always\* work  and are simple to keep track of (just remember the right hand rule and you're done)
So! Use the right hand rule when dealing with rotations (so left is `nōf` and right is `gànōf`), and the rest are, I think fairly clear (e.g. away from you is `mōf` and towards you is `gàmōf`). As a note, ranges that are not directions do not necessarily have canonical "directions" (e.g. warm is `gōf`, but what would `kōf` mean?).

\* technically it's geodesic coordinates that work for all manifolds, but you can parameterize those by polar coordinates and it still works, just be careful about where things fly off to

## Time Travel
So you want to time travel.
