# an entire history of my interactions with nlws's i guess
(copied from the unlws discord [here](https://discord.com/channels/1035950492301402222/1108159862812196984/1108159862812196984))
## pre-history
as a dyslexic kiddo who still liked letters for some reason, i often thought about a 3d script for english through middle and high school
it never went anywhere, but i quickly ran into the problem that as a 3d being, the range of expression of a 3d script is limited to surface features, which put a damper on things, but didn't stop me from attempting to conceptualize what a 4d being's writing system might look like (i might have really gotten into pure math in general and low dim topology in particular)
it did not go anywhere 
but it was a fun thought experiment 
notes to others making 3d writing systems: material and color are probably your best bet for getting around how difficult it is to express a variety of 3-forms predictably
also, and this probably goes without saying, i really liked the lord of the rings growing up. especially the movies (movies are what i was primarily raised on and by after all) but also the books (well except for the dull bits. adhd makes that hard sometimes)
also i loved scifi literature especially philip k dick and isaac asimov (fun fact i toyed with the idea or realizing asimov's predictive history model, but quickly realized that applied math is not for me)
also scifi movies but that list is long and complicated

## Doctor Who
in high school i got really into new who, which was really fun! there's a couple of examples of nlws's in the show but they're never described in detail. the online ones (sherman gallifreyan, which isn't super non-linear and doctors cot which can be but is basically a phonetic alphabet with no language to speak of) were fun to play with and succeeded at catching my imagination. it was fun, but ultimately would probably not become anything more right (foreshadowing)

## Arrival (2016)
it became something more
it's hard to overstate the effect that Arrival had on my willingness to explore language as something more than something that is useful to know about for safety 
it was one of the few moments where my depressed brain was willing to say "actually humans very cool and i want to communicate with them in fun ways"
so, could i make a circle language? well kinda but how do i make a language? also i want inter-circle relations, so it starts getting complicated with graph lines connecting clauses
what a rush! but uh
how do make language?

## the lost years
i took a linguistics class in my first year at uni
what a rush! language is cool! and i can make one! and i have conlang friends now! funny how moving to a city from the middle of nowhere can help with that
i also toyed with making a couple mini conlangs for worldbuilding but it didn't go anywhere 
unfortunately, circle language took a back seat for the rest of uni because i didn't have time to figure out my gender, have friends, do calligraphy, figure out spirituality things, and do school as it was

## the panini press
turns out being told you can't leave your house is a great time to start learning new stuff, like about how to conlang!
also jan misali started making a learn toki pona series so i got excited and downloaded the ebook and right there under names for other conlangs were words i'd been waiting to hear someone else say for a long time: (Unker) Non-Linear Writing System

## UNLWS (2021)
so of course i had to learn it. nobody else in the conlangosphere i interacted with (read: youtube) had done anything on it yet so i was going in with nothing
it took me a month or so to fully parse the documentation, but it was all coming together 
i started doing little spiritual things with it and it felt Good
granted it didn't render right on my ereader so i was working exclusively from my computer, but it didn't matter, someone had done what circle language could never have been
i blinked in the light, seeing the concepts i had imagined as the hollow projections that they were, and as my eyes adjusted, i knew i wanted more

## thek'nganosh, ravoz, and the current day
the rest of the story is well documented at this point between \[the UNLWS discord\] and my own
the only notable thing is that my first try at spoken unlws (thek'nganosh) was largely a failure (it suffered from bloat and generally poor linguistic aesthetics, and was pretty much an Ouwi clone with weird modifications) and while i'm happy to talk about it, all the lessons i learnt in doing so are apparent in ravoz
