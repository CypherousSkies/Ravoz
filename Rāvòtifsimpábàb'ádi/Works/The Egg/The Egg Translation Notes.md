# The Egg
## Translation notes
I'd like the **I** character to almost exclusively reference the garden, and for **you** to mostly utilize the stream but begin referencing the garden further into the story.
### Garden Clusters:
These are "factual" clusters which can be referenced later
- **family** (3-4): **You**, Wife (marriage falling apart, openly sad about your **death**, but actually pretty relieved, and feels guilty about that), and two kids (think of/remember **you** as perfect because they had no time to grow resentful)
- **accident** (0-1): **you** were driving from work to home when you were in a fatal accident with a skidding truck (translate as killed while driving from work to home?). your body was shattered but you felt no pain. The EMTs (doctors) tried to save you but failed. this caused you to **meet** **me**.
- **me** (2-3),(8-9): don't look like God to you, looked like a person -- vague (low-level) authority figure, from some unknowable place
- **you** (6-7): 48 years old, large magnificent soul, a fraction of a larger consciousness, an **egg** of the kind of being **I** am
- **egg** (8-end): the universe is all for **you** to interact with yourself until you mature to be like **me**. everyone on earth is **you**
### Stream Sequences:
Dialogue and commentary on garden clusters carried out in linear time.
- **meeting** (1-2),(3-4): caused by **accident**, references **family**, **you**, and **me**
- **reincarnation** (4-6),(7-8): 
- **self-interaction** (8-10):
- **lesson** (10-end): summarize, emphasize cyclic nature
