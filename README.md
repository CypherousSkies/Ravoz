The `rāvòtifsimpábàb'ádi` project (or just `rāvòzò'ádi` or `rāvòz'ádi` for short, anglicized Rāvòz) is a spiritual artlang (also known by its autonym `tābòkò'afdi`) with a non-linear writing system.
Rāvòz is the successor to Thék'ŋānòsh (itself a stylistic derivative of [Ouwi](https://ouwi.org/index.html) and functional derivative of [UNLWS](https://s.ai/nlws/)), which was simpler and more "complete" (having a closed set of "simple" words), but it didn't *sound* quite right. Also, after the Great Vowel Collapse (don't ask), it became kinda messy to work with. So we're restarting with mostly similar intentions, and hopefully better-fated ends.

Rāvòz is a work-in-progress which I'm happy to watch take on a life of its own among speakers and writers, but is currently also a deeply personal project designed to help me work through some spirituality feelings. That said, don't take it _too_ seriously. Much of it struggles with being the result of too-tight design decisions and a general lack of destination. As such, I've made a discord to talk about/in the language and I'm more than happy to answer questions about it.

## Other Languages in the Non-Linear Family
- As mentioned above, [UNLWS](https://s.ai/nlws/) (Unker Non-Linear Writing System, `tòtābòkò'afdi` or `tòánīlā'afdi`) was critical to the inception of this language, really pushing the bounds of what is possible in a 2d language. It has no spoken form, is somewhat loglang-y, and does distinguish things that are mirrored, but otherwise is very functionally similar to Rāvòz. It has a growing community (possibly the largest non-linear language community) and is the hub for a lot of the discussion around non-linear languages.
- [Ouwi](https://ouwi.org/index.html) (`tòòì'afdi` or `dorāto'afdi`) is similarly important, formalizing flow charts into language in a beautiful speakable angular language. Its vowel stories, while aspirationally very cool to me, are a bit edgy for my tastes, but the language that comes from it is incredibly unique. If you are interested in making your own non-linear writing system, there are some very informative technical guiding documents [here](https://ouwi.org/apology.html) (though if that is your goal, it is definitely worth checking out Sai of UNLWS's foundational essay/manifesto on the same topic [here](https://s.ai/essays/nlf2dws))
- Cesia's NLWS (no link, but see the UNLWS discord) is/will be a relative of UNLWS with a grid aesthetic. I confess I don't follow much of what is there by way of lack of information, but it's still very cool! 
- [Untitled 2D Writing System](https://platonia.net/2d/) is a fusional language in the UNLWS family which, like Rāvòz encloses glyphs in cartouches to indicate their function (though notable only distinguishing nouns and verbs in this way) with a mayan hieroglyphic aesthetic. Interestingly, verbs arguments are distinguished rotationally (except in the case of abbreviative 'relations') which is a fascinating development. The way that glyphs combine graphically is very satisfying, though I, personally, am not fond of the requirement for person things (e.g. builder) to be declined for gender.
- [Orthona](https://www.orthona.net/index.html) is an ortholinear NLWS with 35 glyphs, designed to be easy to input on phones. Its intended structure usage is, interestingly, proverbs. With no crossing-resolution mechanism it is not designed for hyper-complex texts, but gives a similar energy as ancient chinese poetry with complexity from breadth of possible interpretation.

## How to use this Repo

This repo represents my current, up-to-date notes about Ravoz and relevant topics in an [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) mind map/wiki. I've done my best to cite my sources and keep things up to date but most of the non-Ravoz sections (especially on UNLWS) haven't been updated since [[The Rāvòzò'ádi Project|Ravoz]] was [[Thek'nganosh|Thek'nganosh]].

I'd recommend heading over to [[The Rāvòzò'ádi Project]](https://github.com/CypherousSkies/Ravoz/blob/main/R%C4%81v%C3%B2tip%C3%A1b%C3%A0bpi'%C3%A1di/The%20R%C4%81v%C3%B2z%C3%B2'%C3%A1di%20Project.md) to see a better version of this introduction document.
These notes are meant to be read non-linearly, but if you would like a suggestion as to how to read them, follow this:
1.  [[Writing]], peak at [[Phonology]] while you're there
2. [[Grammar]]
3. Jump around Core Vocab docs
4. Jump around Works/Vocab Docs
You can also download one of the book forms of the documentation (see the releases tab) and learn that way (NOTE: the current release is well out of date; i'm working on a new one as there are people who are not me learning the language)

## Highlights of Design Documents

### Goals
- Build a non-linear, dyslexic-friendly writing system
- Be fun to say (read: I want retroflex and tones because I'm Like That)
- Have a featural consonant marking system
- Look smooth and be fun to write (read: I want compatibility with off-the-shelf graph-embedding algorithms)
- Have a relatively small set of "simple" words
- Be polysynthetic to convey non-linear information efficiently and in a cool way when spoken (inspired by the kitchen-sink approach of [Ithkuil](https://ithkuil.place))
- Make the core vocabulary and construction of the language to be ideologically/spiritually significant
	- Gender may only be expressed in ranges
	- Remove references to biological/intrinsic separations (e.g. sex, family, sentient/sapient) where possible
	- Separate people and their characters
	- Make spiritual topics easy to discuss
	- Be poetic wherever possible
- Be compatible with [UNLWS](https://s.ai/nlws/)
- Be easily extensible (e.g. for regularly-constructed combinations and shorthands of sub-graphs be able to form cannonical new glyphs)
- Easily facilitate [garden-stream](https://hapgood.us/2015/10/17/the-garden-and-the-stream-a-technopastoral/)-style conversations and note-taking
- Accommodate Unmarked Poems, where you write something without consonant markings! It wouldn't really be possible to say and are more an exercise in subjectivity than a poem but wow would that be cool.

### Phonology

#### Vowels
There are 3 vowels — `a`, `i`, `o` — and four tones: rising (first, `á`), constant (second, `ā`), falling (third, `à`), and no tone (zeroth, unstressed, `a` or `ȧ`), which are the same as in Mandarin Chinese. They can be written as either vowel-number (e.g. `a1` meaning /a/ with rising tone, with `a` meaning /a/ with no tone) or with their pinyin equivalents (e.g. `á` meaning /a/ with rising tone, `ȧ` or `a` for no tone).
Each vowel-tone pair is represented by a glyph (unit of written information) and is modified by at least one consonant. In general, changing tone corresponds to terminators, constant tone to relations, and no tone to particles.

#### Glyphs
Glyphs are written like this:

type | triangle (i) | circle (a) | irregular (o) 
-|-|-|-
particle ( )| curl-tri | 6 | V 
terminator (/) | 4 | o- | -c
relation (-) | A | /o\ | $\gamma$ˇ 
decorations (\\) | pronouns | numbers/domains | grouping

And function like this:

type | i | a | o
-|-|-|-
. | i-Animacy & Certainty | a-Media | o-Adjectives & Conjugation
/ | í-States of Being | á-Nouns | ó-Questions & Unknowns
\- | ī-Reflexive Relations | ā-Collections | ō-Paths
\\ | ì-Pronouns | à-Domain Markers & Numbers | ò-Grouping

###### Unmarked Glyphs
If, however, a glyph is not marked it may take on a new meaning, usually following what the glyph already stands for:

type | triangle | circle | irregular
-|-|-|-
particle | animate | medium | adj/conj
term | exists | person/noun | question
relation | is/becomes | semantic branch/and/or/cause | path

It should be noted that as the decorations can't really avoid being marked, and so are omitted from this table.

There are many reasons to leave a glyph unmarked (especially for `ā` which is vital to managing the flow of complex graphs), so don't be shy to use them!

#### Consonants
\- | labial |  coronal | retroflex |  velar 
-|-|-|-|-
plosive| `p`/p/ `b`/b/ | `t`/t/ `d`/d/ |  | `k`/k/ `g`/g/ 
nasal| `m`/m/ |  `n`/n/ | | `ŋ`/ŋ/
fricative| `f`/f/ `v`/v/ | `s`/s/ `z`/z/ | `š`/ʂ/ `ž`/ʐ/ | `h`/x/ `x`/ɣ/ 
approximants| | `r`/r,ɾ/ `l` /l/ | `ř`/ɻ/ | 

Consonants are written as modifying a vowel (which should make sense, as the vowel determines the function of a root).

#### Phonotactics
Rules!
1. Syllables are (C)(C)V(C)
2. Dipthongs are allowed but only as shortenings
	1. If two vowels are next to each other and their distinction is desired, are pronounced separately and written as V`'`V.
	2. Otherwise say VV.
		1. If one of the vowels is non-tonal, say the dipthong with the tone of the tonal one
3. a voiced consonant cannot occur next to its unvoiced pair and vice versa (e.g. no `pb`)
4. \[NYI\] Something something sonority hierarchy for onset
	1. a>e>i>\[r ř l\]>\[m n ŋ\]>\[v z ž x\]>\[f s š h\]>\[b d g\]>\[p t k\]
5. \[NYI\] rules for replacing illegal strings with legal ones

### Grammar

#### Parts of Speech:
- **Terminators**: These are intransitive verbs and nouns, things which (generally) form the beginning or end of a sentence.

- **Relations**: These (as the name suggests) are verbs which form a relation between two (or more) loci (so things like "A loves B")

	- As a note the irregular relation (`ō`) is called a **path**, which while not entirely its own grammatical category, is interesting in its own right. It may function as a relation (depicting change from something to something else) or a kind of special terminator (placing something within a range).

- **Particles**: In addition to serving as grammatical modifiers (conjugation, clarifying medium, & kind), they may serve as terminators or relations to relations (e.g. how "liked that" in "I liked that she grabbed flowers" forms a relation between "I" and "grabbed")

- **Decorations**: Grammatically, decorations are much like relations, just far less regular.

	- `ì` syllables are pronouns (which are rarely written) which serve as placeholder connections in linear or complex texts (in practice they are a special kind of relation which function like terminators)

	- `à` syllables are numbers and domain markers, which are written above or below a line to give more information (in practice a kind of particle which cannot serve as a terminator)

	- `ò` syllables are grouping words (including prepositions, parentheses, and [[#Cartouches]]) with a various ways of being written


#### Word order
Word order is largely free, as relation functions are marked fairly clearly, however there are a few conventions:
- try to start and end sentences with terminators.
- if the order of inputs to a relation is important (e.g. "inside of"), then it should go between its arguments, preferring to say the group with the most animate participant first.
- if the order of inputs is not important, say the relation first (or last).
- Try to keep related sections clustered, prioritizing the most animate sections first (e.g. "My girlfriend, who is especially beautiful in dim lighting, came to the (dimly lit) bar with me." is preferable to "My girlfriend came to the bar with me. The bar's dim lighting made her look especially beautiful." unless the observation of her beauty is being emphasized as caused by being in the bar)
