`rāvòtipábàbpidifò` (or just `rāvòzò'ádi` for short, anglicized Rāvòz) is a non-linear spiritual artlang.
It's a successor to Thék'ŋānòsh, which is both simpler and mostly complete (though not posted anywhere), however it doesn't quite *sound* right, and after the Great Vowel Collapse (don't ask), became kinda messy to work with. So we're restarting with mostly similar intentions, and hopefully better-fated ends

## Goals
The goals are as follows:
- Build a non-linear dyslexic-friendly writing system
- Be fun to say
- Have a featural consonant marking system
- Look smooth and be fun to write
- Be poly-synthetic to convey non-linear information efficiently and in a cool way when spoken
- Make the core vocabulary and construction of the language to be ideologically/spiritually significant
	- Gender may only be expressed in ranges
	- Remove references to biological/intrinsic separations (e.g. sex, family, sentient/sapient) where possible
	- While the results of violence should be easy to talk about, causing violence should not
	- Separate people and their characters
	- Make spiritual topics easy to discuss
	- Be poetic wherever possible
- Be compatible with [UNLWS](https://s.ai/nlws/)
- Be easily extensible (e.g. for regularly-constructed combinations and shorthands of sub-graphs be able to form cannonical new glyphs)
- Easily facilitate [garden-stream](https://hapgood.us/2015/10/17/the-garden-and-the-stream-a-technopastoral/)-style conversations and note-taking
- Accommodate Unmarked Poems, where you write something without consonant markings! It wouldn't really be possible to say and are more an exercise in subjectivity than a poem but wow would that be cool.
