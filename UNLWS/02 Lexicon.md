@@ Documentation on combining glyphs

A few notes about translations of glyphs:
- All glyphs are translated as verb phrases (e.g. 'be the author') to emphasize that there aren't 'verbs' *per se*, but rather relations between verb phrases
- The location of the binding points are taken as is from the website and vary substantially. Don't read into it. All glyphs can be rotated to suit your needs
- Out of context glyph translation is a complicated process and some depend strongly on context
- @@Binding points
- There are a lot of holes in the lexicon, but I choose to read this like *toki pona* and combine the relatively small vocab to discuss complex things
- There are also a lot of non-digital glyphs not listed here, though they may be found in the various sketchbooks and videos on Alex and Sai's channels
- I split glyphs into [[Terminators]], [[Relations]], [[Graphs]], [[Numbers]], and the meta-category  [[Line Decorations]].
- I'm including [[Thek'nganosh]] translations too to support speaking.
