## Reading order
In keeping with our renunciation of linearity, reading order is intentionally not defined in UNLWS texts.  Non-linear texts can often be rendered in multiple ways in linear language, depending on where one starts and how one traverses the graph.  As one consequence, UNLWS lacks voice; indeed, it lacks syntactic relations (“subject”, “object”, …), as reified notions different from the grammatical relations of each individual word.  One sentence could be read indifferently as “I bought a muffin from Bob”, “Bob sold me a muffin”, etc.

However, one should not take away from this that information structure has no place in a non-linear language.  Languages frequently have different sentences with the same truth conditions, whose difference is information-structural: the different sentences call out different participants as topical or in focus (which in turn can exert influence on “real meaning”, e.g. perception of agentivity). Many natlangs use fronting and backing transformations for information structure, which is a well-motivated technique in view of human retention and recall and salience biases on time-sequenced items.

A non-linear language optimized for human cognition could be designed to exploit the same biases to the same ends, e.g. by prompting certain reading orders. One shaped by centuries of native usage might even be likely to. At the very least, a completely hands-off approach to the effects of reading order is not necessarily an unalloyed boon.

At present, our nods to information structure in UNLWS are only weak: e.g. focus is indicated by bolding lines. Perhaps this will change in the future.

All the subtleties of reading order and its effects are only compounded when one looks at larger scales, on which discourse structure is relevant.

We presume that all texts exist on an infinite 2D plane.  We view pagination as a misfeature of books and similar media; scrolls bring us closer to the ideal, computers closer yet. We do not yet have a good workaround for writing a boundless text on bounded pages. One can fall back on repeating the same pronoun on different pages.
## Linearity in discourse

As far as possible, we extend non-linearity to the overall discourse structure of texts.  We expect that many discourse structures which are presumed to be necessarily one-dimensional have serviceable alternatives that aren't. Ceteris paribus, we prefer nonlinear representations.

The main truly linear thing we must deal with is Time (supposing no wacky chronophysics). UNLWS has several linear elements which are temporally derived. For example, tense/aspect markers and micrographs both treat time as an axis (radial and polar, respectively).

There are some things — like conversation and narrative — that are severely affected by fully adopting a nonlinear ethic.

We have only started to develop how to hold a conversation in UNLWS itself. As we currently have it, it's a very, very different kind of thing than linear atomic turntaking. Rather, it's a sort of ongoing mutual edit of a shared text. The final text expresses the integrated totality of what the participants have expressed; to fully see the 'conversational' nature, one has to watch or participate live (or write in a medium that keeps revision history). The participants can distinguish their contributions by using different ink colours. But there is no rule against one participant from using another's ink as part of their own expressions: on the contrary, connecting to someone else’s line is the main way to talk about something they brought up.  

There are a few special dialogue variants of glyphs which are meant to be easier to drop in to an already-drawn passage than the normal forms, and cue that one part of a finished conversation was a response to another. These are recognizable by their use of two ink colors. (It’s a pity that it’s so fiddly to edit pencil or pen drawings.) There are other cues as well: material added later to a conversation might be further from the centre, or squeezed into an interstitial space. This fact about use of the page can have pragmatic implications, what one of us have called “steric effects”: if I put part A of my writing in a cramped part of the sentence and leave B accessible to free space, I’m suggesting I want you to respond to B rather than A.

Like conversations, stories could well be nonlinear if one isn't fixated on the temporal sequence of events. Nonlinearity frees one from excessive focus on the history of a single actor in a story, some particular way of reading the whole, etc. Instead, the focus can be on the structural interrelationship of the events and actors; on similarity between higher and lower level structure; etc.

That said, these are our cognitive-aesthetic aims, and it’s still mostly an open question how fully they can be realised. UNWLS is a philosophical language sine qua non, meant to pose these kinds of questions, and so far we have more speculations than answers.
## Rotation and reflection

In UNLWS, overall orientation is not phonemic.  That is, rotating an UNLWS text as a whole on the page does not change the meaning.

Within a text, the orientations of the glyphs are chosen for syntactic reasons of layout, such as to avoid sharp bends in the connecting lines, to make these lines shorter, or just to improve aesthetics.  If we refer in this grammar to absolute directions on the page (“up”, “right”, …) we’re just talking about the way we drew the example in question.

Relative orientation of glyphs with respect to other elements of the same text, for example what points at what, may be significant.  In other words, UNLWS does not use absolute left-right / up-down axes; rather, it uses local radial / polar axes, relative to each element.

Mirror reflection is also phonemic: flipping things over makes a difference.  Like many phonemic contrasts it makes sometimes more systematic differences (flipping a graph inverts the sense of an axis), sometimes less (“be next to” becomes “be in” when flipped).
