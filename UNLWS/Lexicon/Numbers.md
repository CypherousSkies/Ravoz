# Numbers
Alex and Sai use a prime factorization system to write numbers (e.g. 4=2x2, 6=2x3, 1/2=2^-1) as an implicit system, but a digit-based system (or additive power series) is also possible assuming you know the implicit representation of the base you're writing in (e.g. write `[3,2] base 2*5` as a stack, see below)
