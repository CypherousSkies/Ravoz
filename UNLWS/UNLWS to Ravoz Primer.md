# A Primer on Rāvòz for UNLWS
Hi! I'm sure you're curious what all this about an UNLWS derivative is, so this is my primer/AMA on Ravoz.
The big TL;DR is that Ravoz is to UNLWS as Japanese is to Chinese: Their writing systems are deeply intertwined and very much compatible, but they are different paradigms in expression and assumption.

## Important things going in
1. Much like how UNLWS is Alex & Sai's, Ravoz is mine. I won't claim "ownership" and I'm happy to watch it live its own life, but I'm also using it to work through specific things that I'm feeling as a person, so it has a bunch of idiosyncrasies which are personal. 
2. Ravoz is fully compatible with UNLWS!\*
3. Ravoz has a spoken version! it's polysynthetic, tonal, and has retroflex consonants because i'm Like This but it exists!
4. Ravoz is a spiritual art/englang, and so many of the works are related to spiritual experience (if that's not your vibe that's okay!)
5. Ravoz is aesthetically derived (and has parts whole-cloth stolen) from Ouwi

### Important distinctions/changes from UNLWS
1. I'm dyslexic, so anything that is the same up to 3d rotations is confusing to me, which in the 2d case means mirror images aren't great for me (see dbqp, also above/below the line distinctions), so my language reflects this. If there is a distinction in UNLWS that would be the same up to a mirror image, it's not a distinction in Ravoz.
2. Gender may only be expressed as ranges
3. Anything that relies on an intrinsic property (e.g. biology) is strongly discouraged
4. There's a four-way animacy system (which is encouraged but not required) which apply to nouns but are not intrinsic to the noun (e.g. a computer is a tool and so animate, but if it starts doing stuff without me telling it to, it's person):
	1. bi, "inanimate", things that are acted on, but do not act, one-off knowable
	2. di, "animate", things that are skills, tools, characters, things that act on another's will
	3. pi, "person", things that have agency, people, things that continuous effort is required to know
	4. ti, "enigmatic", things that are outside the above categories, are unknowable, are spirits/gods/etc.
5. I renamed cartouches to parentheticals because Ravoz also has ways to enclose glyphs into a functional unit or change its function, which makes more sense to be called cartouches in my mind

## How to get started
Firstly, I'd recommend cloning the repo and using Obsidian to view it (it's free) because it's easier to follow the hyperlinks that way.
If you already know UNLWS, you might start at [[UNLWS-Ravoz Dictionary]] to get feel for how the two languages literally translate — you might also start at [[Writing]], just to see what's different.
If you don't or just want a different way to approach it, I'd recommend reading [[Grammar]], [[Writing]] (taking a peak at [[Phonology]] to see how consonants are marked), then jumping around the Core Vocab docs, and checking out the Works folder.
