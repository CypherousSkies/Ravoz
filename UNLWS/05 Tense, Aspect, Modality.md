## Tense, Aspect

## Modality
The forms glossed as questions below do not have the illocutionary force of questions baked in.  They can thus be used e.g. in embedded questions: “I don’t want to know what (if anything) the cat ate” would bind the object of “know” loosely, with a gap, to the “what” in “the cat ate what”.
### Irrealis Gap
This irrealis gap indicates an irrealis relation. The hook is optional, and indicates the side that is realis.  Without a hook it is understood that both sides are realis, and it’s only this single relation which is not being asserted.  With a hook, the side without the hook behaves like a possible world.  See the next section.

The hook can fuse with the expected line decoration, and possibly others. See e.g. food in the lexicon.
