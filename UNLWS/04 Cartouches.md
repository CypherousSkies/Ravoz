# Cartouches
A cartouche is something that surrounds a section of text, to group it together.  The most ideal way to draw one in UNLWS is as a subtly shaded background behind the section of text. Partial cartouches, where the shading fades on its inside to the same background color as the outside, are acceptable too.  That is, cartouche boundaries may be drawn as lines which shade off gradually on one side.  For practical pen-and-paper usage, cartouche boundaries may be drawn as lines of any other sort whose timbre is distinct from ordinary lines, for instance dotted or dashed lines.  Drawing them identically to ordinary lines would be confusing and is to be avoided. 

Regardless of which kind of cartouche is used, it is perfectly acceptable to draw only whichever parts of the boundary are necessary for clarity. The resulting ambiguity in what is enclosed might even be desirable.

It is frequent that lines penetrate the boundary of a cartouche, to make binding points inside and outside the cartouche coreferential.

One frequent use of cartouches is to provide a binding point for some text as a whole, rather than any particular element.  This is used, for example, by mentioned text.  In this case the line binding to the cartouche will terminate in a mention marker, and not physically connect. 

A second use of cartouches is to explicitly indicate scope for certain grammatical elements, for instance quantifiers like “all”, or the irrealis marker.  This can become important when there is coreference crossing the boundary of the scope.

## Counterfactuals
UNLWS has a facility for expressing possible and/or counterfactual worlds, which is used, for instance, to handle “if”.  This is along the lines of work such as [Lewis’ counterpart theory](https://www.google.com/url?q=http://knoesis.wright.edu/students/topher/courses/phillang/lewis.pdf&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1647419595009139&usg=AOvVaw3N9FDFW6KGs_4xC0o63JMr).

A world is expressed as double-lined [[#Cartouches]], with an outer dashed line with long inter-dash separation surrounding an inner cartouche boundary of any valid sort.  The outer line can be drawn only partially, just like the inner one.

Binding points and relations inside the cartouche are interpreted in the possible or counterfactual world of the cartouche. Relation lines may cross the cartouche boundaries, e.g. to state something hypothetical of a real referent (for Lewis, its counterpart). 

Binding points and relations can also sit between the two layers of the boundary. These are interpreted as defining the kinds of possible or counterfactual worlds being considered. That is, this construction establishes a quantification over worlds with the material inside just one layer is the restrictor and the material inside two layers the scope. The quantifier can be specified as any of UNLWS’ articles by placing the article straddling the inner cartouche, as discussed in [[Line Decorations#Articles]].

If no article is specified the generic is understood. This allows the construction to serve for “if”: a sentence “if X, then Y” is translated as “in worlds where X holds, Y holds”, with the generic matching the bare plural on “worlds”. 

The gap in a rel line for irrealis modality can be taken as creating a world, too.  The question of whether it really does, I think, is academic.
