### General Thoughts
I really like UNLWS, but the lack of a [[01 Renderer|Renderer]] makes things difficult to generate large texts digitally, quickly, and verifiably.
The documentation linked above is very technical and not super helpful for a first-time reader, but I'm starting to get the hang of it, even if I have virtually no way of checking if my drawings are correct.
For now, I'm also treating the language a lot like *toki pona* in that I'm using the simple available vocab to generate more complex vocab.
### Purpose of These Documents
I'd like to lay out a better collection of resources that are more friendly to quick checking than the core document.
I'll probably leave most of the documentation as I found them, but given how that document was generated over the course of years, mine will probably be less confusing, at least to me, and especially as reference while working on [[Thek'nganosh]].
