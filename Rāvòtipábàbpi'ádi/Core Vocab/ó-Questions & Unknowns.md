`ó` words are, by themselves, just unknowns; lacking the power of a question and more akin to words like "someone". To give them the power of a question, combine it with an [[i-Animacy & Certainty|irrealis]] gap at the point of uncertainty (e.g. "Is there anyone you trust?" vs "Who do you trust?").
