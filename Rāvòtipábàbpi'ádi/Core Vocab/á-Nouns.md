## Author/Me distinction
Something that's useful to note here is that the author of a document (the "I" in most statements) is distinct from the being that continues on after writing it. That is to say that if I wrote a book and then a letter two years later, those are two distinct authors, but "I" am continuous between them. It's a kinda weird quirk but I claim the difference is important.

As a point of comparison, natural languages also have this distinction in poetic analysis. It's usually useful to remove the author from the poem and instead make conclusions about the "speaker" (who in the poem is noted with 1st person pronouns, or whose perspective the poem is from). As a consequence of poetry, the speaker may ambiguously correspond to the creator (here the *person* who wrote the poem). Keeping them decoupled allows for a more meaningful conversation about the *text* without drawing (potentially false) conclusions about the creator's *real* experience.

## A note on the choices of shapes
I only picked shapes which tessellate/honeycomb space (and spheres) — yes it's a little obtuse but they are the most fundamental shapes in a real sense. To give a non-mathematical intuition for why these shapes are important, consider that Rāvòz is a language which attempts to fully use the space it is written in, so dividing 2d or 3d space into units is an important function. I include 4d words mostly as a curiosity, but also as a gateway to talking about somewhat enigmatic shapes which sit tantalizingly at the edge of what's imaginable.
