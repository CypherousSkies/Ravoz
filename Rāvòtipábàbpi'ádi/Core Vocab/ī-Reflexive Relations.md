`ī` words are order-2 relations with a directed and undirected presentations, generally representing reflexive relationships. Directed is said with a syllable-final `n`

@@example undirected
`@@` meaning "@@"

@@example directed
`@@` meaning "@@"

The meaning of this relation depends on the animacy of the participants. While this relation has a directed and undirected version. A natural consequence of animacy is then that directed and undirected relations with exactly one inanimate participant are fully equivalent as an inanimate participant is always being acted upon by its more animate counterpart.

When both participants are inanimate, directed information becomes somewhat nonsensical, with cogent analogies being things like doors which when passed through, don't lead back to where they started; so while a directed inanimate-inanimate `ī` relation is potentially understandable, it is usually non-physical, with more information being conveyed by ascribing some animacy to at least one of the participants (e.g. the impossible door is animately, or perhaps enigmatically, changing).

Additionally, the enigmatic forms are not glossed here as they either follow from the others by analogy or are difficult (for me) to conceptualize. There are a small number of exceptions, however: `nī` means "fully unknowable to"; `ŋī` means something like existential horror; and `zī` usually refers to the notion of a personal soul (see [[ì-Pronouns#You and your soul]]).

ŋ | surprising/previously unknown/unsettling (e.g. a creepy-looking doll) | spooky (e.g. sound over radio) | scary (e.g. monster) | that which is (attempted to be) scared (e.g. the bunny is scared of me but I'm not scared of them)
b | for influence to fall on deaf ears (e.g. an unwilling student) | passively influence (listen) | actively influence | that which is (attempted to be) influenced but doesn't necessarily influence back (e.g. a para-social relationship)
d | be possessed for the sake of possession (e.g. a collectible) | use, passively have | make, actively have | that which is (attempted to be) had/made
p | spiritually related | passively forgive, say sorry | actively forgive, make amends | that which is (attempted to be) forgiven but does not necessarily forgive in return
t | confusing pairing | passively confuse | actively confuse | that which is (attempted to be) confused but is understandable/understood

v | often put together (ginger & garlic) | passively choose (e.g. opt-out) | actively choose (e.g. opt-in) | that which is chosen but doesn't necessarily reciprocate 
z | always together (e.g. light & heat) | integrated part of (e.g. arm) | integrated conscious part of (e.g. gestalt, partner) | that which is integrated but does not necessarily incorporate itself into the whole (e.g. a transplanted organ being rejected by the host)
