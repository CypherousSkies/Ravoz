`ì` words are decorations which mostly encompass pronouns. It's usually written as a triangle with a line emitting from the middle of one of the sides with the consonant marking inside the triangle (unless it's a [[#Name pronouns|name pronoun]]), with the exception of `rì`, `lì`, and `řì` which are written with their [[Terminators#I you we|UNLWS]] counterparts.


C | Inanimate | Animate | Person | Enigmatic
-|-|-|-|-
r | This document, my physicality | I, the author/speaker | I, me the person beyond the text | I, a God/spirit
l | You, the audience | You, the referent of the speaker | You, the person beyond the text | You, a God/spirit
ř | Our physicality | Us, the speaker & referent (exclusive) | We, the people beyond the text (inclusive) | We Gods/spirits
name | physicality | character/aspect | person beyond the text | god/spirit

## Names
Names have a particular structure to them: the first syllable of a name is always a pronoun (whose consonant marking extends outside of the triangle), then a string of phonetic syllables, and ending with an [[i-Animacy & Certainty|animacy]] marking (`i` by default), but this may be omitted. For example my name (/nira/ or /naira/) is said `nìrā'i` or `nìrā`, depending on the emphasis on animacy that is desired.

For those who desire a small amount of structure, the phonetic part of a name should be 1-2 syllables long and should only be your (chosen) personal name, not culture or family name. Additionally the pronoun part shouldn't start with `r`, `l`, `ř`.

If for funsies you wanted more than a first name, then feel free to construct a name in the vein of `[name]išò([group name]'ā' | [ā word])šo[unknown important to you]'ì` e.g. for me, `nìrāšòmāšòzó'ì` or possibly `nìrāšòmāzó'i`. Again, have fun with it. I'm not attached to any specific convention.
### Name pronouns
Name pronouns are just shortenings of the full name (e.g. the first syllable of the name), but if that isn't distinct enough, add a consonant to the end of the pronoun syllable from elsewhere in the name (so you could refer to me as `nì` or `nìr`). If not otherwise specified, the name pronoun inherits the last animacy attributed to the name (so in these notes I am animate, but if I were talking to you directly, I'm probably a person).

## You and your soul
An interesting question for a language without possession is how to refer to your soul. I'm of several minds for what paradigm (for example: is your soul distinct from others? if not, how intertwined are they? if we think of the soul as the source of individuation, how much metaphysical weight should I put on it?) to use for this, but I think, for now, I will make the following assertions:
- The soul is the source of individuation: in other words, it's what makes you yourself, and thus is inseparable from you.
- The soul is enigmatic: it's beyond total comprehension by yourself, as you are a part of it.

So, this means that the best way to talk about this concept of the soul is to say `*zī(bàb)'áti` (lit: "the integrated (spiritual) part of \* which is enigmatic"). Because I like the idea of not saying that every time I mean to say "my soul", if you have established that the entity that you are talking about is not (usually) enigmatic (e.g. people, animals), you can just mark them as enigmatic and be understood (e.g. instead of saying `rìzī(bàb)'áti`, I could say `rìti` without ambiguity).

## Branch Pronouns
In linear speech/writing, because of Ravoz's non-linear nature, it's sometimes necessary to mark and refer back to branches (e.g. a part of a relation which you are withholding) later. To establish a branch pronoun say `*ìv` (where `*` is any consonant except `r,l,ř`), either in a relation or connected to a parenthetical, and to reference it later say `*ìz` (matching consonants). This means you can have up to 17 named branches! If you run out and want to reuse a branch pronoun, you can "zero it out" by saying `sàb*ìv`. If you really want more markers (or want to half-describe what they are) you may use name construction rules with the suffixes `'ìv` and `'ìz` (written inside a triangle cartouche).
Generally I wouldn't recommend using more than a few for clarity's sake but in situations where complexity is innate and self-reference is inevitable, it's good to have rules.
### `pò`/`zò` construction
Additionally, because it's nice to have an alternative way of doing things, if the thing you're referencing is sufficiently simple, it may be easier to just say the thing being referenced rather than define a pronoun for it (especially when you've defined something simple like "good things" and want to specify something like "the aforementioned good things"). In this case, when you reference the word again, suffix it with a word-final `p` (standing in for `pò` meaning "that branch") or conjugate it with `zò` (e.g. `*p` or `zò*` where `*` is the word in question, sort of how pro- in pronoun works in english).
### Examples
For example in my (linear) translation of [[Doctor Who Quotes#Good Things Bad Things]], the core of the quote is describing and giving context to good things and bad things. While it would be fairly clear to keep saying `dàgo` and `dàko`, I think it conveys more structure (and gives more of a hint to how it's written) to keep referring back to the *specific idea* of those good and bad things, so when they come up I refer to them as `dàgop`/`zòdàgo` and `dàkop`/`zòdàko`.
Additionally, lines 2 and 4 are referenced by line 3, so instead of trying to contain them all into one line (e.g. `rò zòdàgo kořā mò dàkop žo go rò vò lò zòdàko kořā mò dàgop žo go lò āg rì favmo` which is very clunky), so instead I marked the `rò` parenthetical as `mì` and the `lo` parenthetical as `nì`, so that line 3 now reads `mìv vò nìv āg rì favmo`. This is pretty meaningless on its own (it literally translates as "I feel it's important that this and that"), so I preceded the `rò` and `lò` with their respective pronoun references, which mark them as connected.
