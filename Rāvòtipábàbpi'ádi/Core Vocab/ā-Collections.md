`ā` words are order 2+ relations, generally representing collections and their actions. Undirected relations stemming from an `ā` glyph are actions upon the whole collection. The directed part can be inferred by word order (\<undirected parts\> \*ā \<directed parts\>), which can be reversed (\<directed parts\> \*āg \<undirected parts\>). Terminators are marked with syllable-final `f`. This relation has two presentations, each with some nuances:

**Semi-directed Relation**:
`>o>-` The directed and directed components are glossed separately, despite them sharing space, defining different relationships among groups.

**Terminator**:
`o>-` Essentially the terminator version of the relation, distinct from `á` words, generally representing the noun form of these relationships (e.g. lover).

## A note on Causation
I'm choosing to make `řā` not apply to causing states (`í` words among others) but only nouns (as in to create), events, and situations. Specifically this is to make it difficult to speak of doing violence (specifically, causing harm), while preserving the ability to talk about the results of it (you can still say A is hurt and why, but without the baggage of an appearance of objectivity that causation implies).

### Talking about harm
To work around this, I would personally use a `lā` construction, which for gets around a causal relationship and instead focuses on the results of a situation. For example, suppose A is in a situation S (like "A and B were angry with each-other") where A got hurt, then it would make sense to say:

S `vò rìpi lā bav` A `fí`
(loosely: "According to me, A was forcibly hurt by being in the situation S")

The result of this structure (which is fairly clunky in english), is that responsibility and intent are not brought into the situation, while still getting across the important part, namely that A was hurt.
