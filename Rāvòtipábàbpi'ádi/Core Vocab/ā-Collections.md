`ā` words are order 2+ relations, generally representing collections and their actions. Undirected relations stemming from an `ā` glyph are actions upon the whole collection. The directed part can be inferred by word order (\<undirected parts\> \*ā \<directed parts\>), which can be reversed (\<directed parts\> \*āg \<undirected parts\>). Terminators are marked with syllable-final `f`. This relation has two presentations, each with some nuances:

**Semi-directed Relation**:
`>o>-` The directed and directed components are glossed separately, despite them sharing space, defining different relationships among groups.

**Terminator**:
`o>-` Essentially the terminator version of the relation, distinct from `á` words, generally representing the noun form of these relationships (e.g. lover).
