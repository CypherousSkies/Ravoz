## Person-animate-inanimate-enigmatic distinction (Animacy)
Animacy is a property of nouns and collections, and like all properties is not intrinsic.

Broadly, an animate object is something can do something. So a mug is animate (it holds water) but a couch is inanimate (things sit on it). 

A person is then something that can do something *with intent*. So a cat is a person in this way (a cat can mean to push a mug off the table), but an oven is not (it must operate on someone else's authority, not its own).

To sidestep the inevitable conversation of free will, it's fair to assume that if it can do something without input from another person, it's a person -- the main exception being that abstractions (cultures, governments, etc.) are always at most animate.
In an interesting turn of events, this also means that some objects are *sometimes* people: like a computer suddenly doing its own thing is a person, but when being used to write, it's just animate.

The enigmatic category is somewhat less tangible. Something is enigmatic if there is either no clear way to place it into the former categories (even as a passing member) or assigning person-esc agency would be reductive (e.g. a god). As with person-hood, something can be given enigmatic status only in certain contexts; for example, the Sun, when being referred to in a cosmic sense is enigmatic (solar flares are unpredictable, it may grow hotter or colder on inhumanly long timescales or on an unknowable whim), but as a part of the sky (e.g. the day-night cycle) is animate.
