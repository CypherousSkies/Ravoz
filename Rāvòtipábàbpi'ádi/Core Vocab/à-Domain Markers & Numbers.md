These decorations represent [[Line Decorations#Domain Emblems|domain markers]] and numbers! If it's marked (with a `ŋ`-esc loop above the line, said with a syllable final `b`), then it becomes a relation with an action (with the exception of `bà` and `dà` which just have different presentations).

Each of these is written differently:
numbers are written the [[Numbers|UNLWS]] way

C | Unmarked (written) | Marked (marking)
-|-|-
m | plural, few e.g. <= 6 (right angle b ligature) | make few (dot above)
n | plural, many e.g. > 6 <= 36 (right angle j ligature) | make many (dot above)
ŋ | plural, lots e.g. > 36 (right angle round P ligature) | make lots (dot above)
b | celestial (three dots) | spiritual (trefoil)
d | gestalt (floating bend towards rel) | social (floating figure 8)
p | passive ranged/reversible (touching bend towards rel) | active ranged/partially reversible (`b` mark)
t | passive touch/partially irreversible (bend away from rel) | active touch/irreversible (`b` mark)
s | 0 | none
f | 1, a | the, usually 1
š | 2 | double
ž | 3 | triple
v | 5 | quintuple
z | 6 | 6^n (where n is syllable-final consonant)
r | ?
l | ?
ř | ?
g | -1, reverse (underline dash) | no, not, negate (slash)
k | seximal point | reciprocal
h | raised to the power, continuous | repeated application, discrete
x | addition point | b6 notation

## Numbers
Hey so numbers are a thing. They're a special kind of adjective which can be animated to act as multiplication. In general, multiplication is the default as in spoken settings, making working logarithmically easiest.
For numbers smaller than what would be called `ŋà`, you can either use base six (putting)
