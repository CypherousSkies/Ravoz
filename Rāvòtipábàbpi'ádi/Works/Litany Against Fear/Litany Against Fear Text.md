1) I must not fear.
2) Fear is the mind-killer.
3) Fear is the little-death that brings total obliteration.
4) I will face my fear.
5) I will permit it to pass over me and through me.
6) And when it has gone past, I will turn the inner eye to see its path.
7) When the fear has gone there will be nothing. Only I will remain.
