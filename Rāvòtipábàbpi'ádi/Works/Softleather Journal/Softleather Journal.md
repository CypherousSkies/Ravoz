So I wanted to make a cover for my journal that I made.
I had a number of ideas, but ultimately I settled on something reminiscent of my sketches for [[Mothself]]. (This version has an error: `líti` should be negated)

Transcription:
>`má zōlimfákòhòbi'ōh sò āg bá, dá, vò sif.`
>	`máp topō zī mìz sò dí sò ŋāf sò ta sò gí sò ní sò mìv.`
>	`pōftitof, gàbríti, vò gàblíti ā zīn máp.`	

Rough Translation:
> "An entity creates tapestries, stories, and experiences using ink on the physicality of what this is written on.
> 	"Said entity travels the foretold path from chaos to consonance to glitch to reality-fabric and back again in an integrated cycle.
> 	"The Eternal Change, and neither Is nor Is Not, integrate (but is not integrated by) the entity."

As you can see, it's not super meaningful, but is intended instead to just be pretty (the `zōh` path traces the shape of a luna moth wing). The final version which will be laser engraved onto the journal will be the unmarked form (below) as I like the idea of reading the cover as something new every time I read it (which given that there are $21^{20}\sim2.78\times10^{26}$ possible ways of filling it in, I think it will).
