# A Lesson in Linguistic Antimemetics
## Or, On Removing Violence

When I set out to make *thék'ŋānòsh* and *rāvòz*, I had a thought in reaction to one of *Ouwi*'s vowel stories: "can I make causing harm difficult to talk about while not trivializing the harm done?" While *thék'ŋānòsh* never really got to a point where that was a feasible goal, or even one I could think about terribly carefully, I have expended a lot of thought around doing so with *rāvòz*. Unfortunately, I no longer believe it is possible for a language like *rāvòz* to both make doing harm difficult to talk about and talking about the effects of harm easy. What follows are my collected notes and thoughts along with historical mini-essays with my analysis of why they didn't work. To spoil the conclusion, I do still think it is possible to make causing harm difficult, but I believe that is the domain of cultural norms. Careful choice of core vocabulary and grammar may certainly help, but a language that can talk about the effects of violence, in my reckoning, will be able to talk about the causes.

### Historical notes
Included here for completeness are some of my previous attempts to do this.
#### A note on Causation (originally in documentation for `ā`)
I'm choosing to make `řā` (at the time meaning 'cause', replaced by `niv`) not apply to causing states (`í` words among others) but only nouns (as in to create), events, and situations. Specifically this is to make it difficult to speak of doing violence (specifically, causing harm), while preserving the ability to talk about the results of it (you can still say A is hurt and why, but without the baggage of an appearance of objectivity that causation implies).
##### Talking about harm
To work around this, I would personally use a `lā` (at the time meaning 'imply', use `ŋiv` instead) construction, which for gets around a causal relationship and instead focuses on the results of a situation. For example, suppose A is in a situation S (like "A and B were angry with each-other") where A got hurt, then it would make sense to say:

S `vò rìpi lā bav` A `fí`
(loosely: "According to me, A was forcibly hurt by being in the situation S")

The result of this structure (which is fairly clunky in english), is that responsibility and intent are not brought into the situation, while still getting across the important part, namely that A was hurt.
##### Why this didn't work
Functionally, all this did was disallow specific structures with no other design elements to support their removal. It's a bit like removing the word 'purple' from english; without cutting out more color words, one could just replace it with a compound word or similar structure. Seeing as *rāvòz* is designed to be able to collect words together to make new canonical words and structures, this theoretical hybrid structure would just make a compound word stand in for the action of causing harm.

In order to completely remove this, I would have to make `ā` words completely incompatible with parentheticals, which still wouldn't fix `i` words like `piv` (intend), which function like parentheticals. Essentially, this would necessitate parentheticals and rel-to-rel relations to be removed, which makes complex non-linear writing nigh impossible, defeating the purpose of *rāvòz*.

### Redaction and Antimemetics, a Theoretical Basis
Antimemetics, while a fictional concept, is useful here as a framework for how I have come to think about this problem. In the field of Memetics, which aimed apply concepts form evolutionary biology to ideas (a premise that ultimately failed as the marketplace of ideas does not and never will exist except in forms like 4chan), a 'meme' is a thinkable unit (e.g. a name, concept, etc.). While the field is discredited, ironically its cultural legacy lives on, and has received many fictional extensions; such as 'antimemes', things which cannot be thought or expressed (e.g. SCP-510 which cannot have a positive definition, although it is "not round, not round at all").

What I was attempting here was to make 'doing harm' an antimeme at a linguistic level. The problem is that, absent the ability to make doing violence an actual antimeme, I would have  to remove memetic structures around 'doing harm' until it is inexpressible as a combination of memes. Unfortunately, the memes which are the results of harm *are* desirable and can be expressed as and by the meme 'doing harm'. Really the issue here is that both are expressible as the memes 'intent/cause/effect' and 'harm'. I can't remove 'harm', so I will have to break down 'intent/cause/effect' into something I can remove. Unfortunately, this is incredibly difficult to remove subtly.

In a future project, I might try to start with this premise and move forward from there, but I don't look forward to that. I think it'll feel like a room with all the corners padded or using a mac; it doesn't actually stop you from doing anything, it just makes it difficult in increasingly obtuse ways.

### Culture, a Cop-Out Solution
I didn't want to say this, but I do think the only real answer here is to just not talk about doing harm very often. Like not just at an individual level, but make talking about doing violence taboo, and focus instead on what you can say about its effects. This is about as effective as 'write your congressman' but I think it's the only real solution.
