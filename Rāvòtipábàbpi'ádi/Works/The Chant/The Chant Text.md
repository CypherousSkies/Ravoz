**I'm walking in the corridor**
I'm walking through a brutalist corridor. The strong concrete lines press in on me, as I scan the darkened walls for any deviation.
There is a light at the end, disguising its contents while revealing how nonsensically blank this corridor is.
**The corridor leads to an atrium
in the atrium is a door**
I stand on a balcony of a similarly brutalist atrium. I look down at the mosaic, a collection of blue-green, red, and black tiles forming a sigil-- a seal.
My seal.
As I stare down, it grows closer, and after a few moments I'm standing on it.
I don't look up.
**beyond the door is a tunnel
in the tunnel are the figures**
I'm in a pitch black space of unknown dimension, the atrium behind me already forgotten by this expanse of nothingness.
I walk forwards.
As my eyes adjust I see the floating forms of twelve people, indescernable for everything but their outline.
I walk beneath them.
The nothingness goes on.
**beyond the figures are the windows**
I pass windows, too bright to see through, but not bright enough to illuminate this blank void.
I try to see the walls supporting them, but the appear to just exist, floating in the nothingness.
**at the end of the tunnel is the Great Tree**
In a second the black nothing opens to the foot of a massive tree.
I feel weightless after the journey, lifted from my feet as my perspective shifts upwards, above this sprawling forest.
**I am a bird and fly above the forest
I find the clearing
in the clearing is the flower
I touch the flower and am relaxed**
