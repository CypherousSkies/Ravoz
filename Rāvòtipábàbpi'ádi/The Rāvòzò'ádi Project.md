The `rāvòtifsimpábàb'ádi` project (or just `rāvòzò'ádi` or `rāvòz'ádi` for short, anglicized Rāvòz) is a non-linear spiritual artlang.
It's a successor to [[Thek'nganosh|Thék'ŋānòsh]], which is both simpler and mostly complete, however it doesn't quite *sound* right, and after the Great Vowel Collapse (don't ask), became kinda messy to work with. So we're restarting with mostly similar intentions, and hopefully better-fated ends.

## Goals
The goals are as follows:
- Build a non-linear dyslexic-friendly writing system
- Be fun to say
- Have a featural consonant marking system
- Look smooth and be fun to write
- Be poly-synthetic to convey non-linear information efficiently and in a cool way when spoken
- Make the core vocabulary and construction of the language to be ideologically/spiritually significant
	- Gender may only be expressed in ranges
	- Remove references to biological/intrinsic separations (e.g. sex, family, sentient/sapient) where possible
	- While the results of violence should be easy to talk about, causing violence should not
	- Separate people and their characters
	- Make spiritual topics easy to discuss
	- Be poetic wherever possible
- Be compatible with [[00 UNLWS|UNLWS]]
- Be easily extensible (e.g. for regularly-constructed combinations and shorthands of sub-graphs be able to form cannonical new glyphs)
- Easily facilitate [garden-stream](https://hapgood.us/2015/10/17/the-garden-and-the-stream-a-technopastoral/)-style conversations and note-taking
- Accommodate Unmarked Poems, where you write something without consonant markings! It wouldn't really be possible to say and are more an exercise in subjectivity than a poem but wow would that be cool.

## Table of Contents
One document for a whole language is kinda restrictive so I've broken it into a few parts (which you are not obligated to read in order):
1. [[Writing]]: How the language is written (which should give away the design philosophy)
2. [[Phonology]]: The rules of pronunciation
3. [[Grammar]]: How to say non-linear sentences
4. [[Unmarked Poems]]: A language-specific artform which is an exercise in subjectivity
5. [[Ceremonial Script]]: A calligraphic script for `rāvòzò'ádi`
