## Mythologies
I use the word pantheon here somewhat erroneously, simply meaning "collection of entities to be worshiped". It is true that I miss many kinds of belief here, but this section only deals in broad strokes, and a specific system should have its own suffix.
As with writing any name, be sure to enclose the names of gods in carouches, in these cases being particularly careful to close them off lest they hear their name 
### Animist Pantheon: `-hàti`
Suffix lit: "continuous spirits", continuous here meaning something more like "everything" or "inclusive" as everything has a spirit
- Generic spirit: `fàmáhàti` (lit: "one of the continuous spirits")
- Creator spirit: `míhàti` (lit: "that (continuous) which is capable of creating life from nothing")
- Ch'ał: `šìal(hà)ti` (translit + optional suffix)
### Monotheistic Pantheon: `-fàbti`
Suffix lit: "usually 1 god", usually is used here as monotheistic gods tend to have many aspects, see catholic trinity, also to avoid calling God `fàti` which doesn't sound good in English
- Generic monotheistic God: `dáfàbti` (lit: "the one God")
- Creator monotheistic God: `mífàbti` (lit: "the one (God) capable of creating life from nothing")
- Emphasis on singular God: `ìfàbti` (lit: "the one God")
- Allah: `ìalā(fab)ti` (translit + optional suffix)
- Yahweh: `ìāvíh(fàb)ti` (translit + optional suffix)
### Polytheistic Pantheon: `-hàbnàti`
Suffix lit: "discrete God(s)", discrete here means something more like "separate" or "isolated" or "exclusive" as not everything is alive or has a God
- Polytheistic gestalt: `máhàbnàti` (lit: "the many Gods")
- Generic polytheistic God: `máfàhàb(nà)ti` (lit: "one (of the many) discrete god(s)")
- Creator polytheistic God: `míhàbti` (lit: "that (discrete) which is capable of creating life from nothing")
- Zeus: `zìos(hàb)(nà)ti` (translit + optional suffix)
- Apollo: `ìpolo(hàb)(nà)ti` (translit + optional suffix)
