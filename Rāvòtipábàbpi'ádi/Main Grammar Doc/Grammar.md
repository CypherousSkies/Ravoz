# Grammar
## Word order
Word order is largely free, as relation functions are marked fairly clearly, however there are a few conventions:
- try to start and end sentences with terminators.
- if the order of inputs to a relation is important (e.g. "inside of"), then it should go between its arguments, preferring to say the group with the most animate participant first.
- if the order of inputs is not important, say the relation first (or last).
- Try to keep related sections clustered, prioritizing the most animate sections first (e.g. "My girlfriend, who is especially beautiful in dim lighting, came to the (dimly lit) bar with me." is preferable to "My girlfriend came to the bar with me. The bar's dim lighting made her look especially beautiful." unless the observation of her beauty is being emphasized as caused by being in the bar)

## Polysyllabic construction
1. A "locus" centers around a root glyph and is either "simple" (e.g. just a root, possibly with a cap), or "complex":
	- Complex relation loci form as follows: `[nested?]+[conj]+<root>+[medium]+[domain]+[animacy]+[certainty]+[adj]+<cap>`
	- Complex terminator loci form as follows: `[nested?]+[conj]+<root>+[domain]+[animacy]+[number]+[adj]+<cap>`
	- Complex conj (`o`) loci: `[nested?]+<root>+[adj]+<cap>`
	- Complex media (`a`) loci form as follows: `[nested?]+<root>+([particle]+[kind] | [rel2rel]+[direction]+[mood])+[adj]+<cap>`
	- Complex animacy/domain (`à`/`i`) loci form as follows: `[nested?]+<root>+[adj/animacy/domain]+<cap>`
		- repetitions of a root intensify (e.g. to distinguish a computer and a hammer one might refer to the former as "animate animate" or "animate person" and the second as "animate" or "animate inanimate")
	- Complex certainty (`i`) loci form as follows: `<root>+[adj/certainty]+<cap>`
2. Loci come together in the following way:
	1. The functional core (the "root") always appears first
	2. Each modifying locus in any\* order (preferring to keep connected portions together), clarifying connection to other loci (if necessary) with vowel particles, and noting external binding points with pronouns
3. Caps are constructed based on the kind of glyph: (function here means stating the operative vowel, preceded with an apostrophe e.g. `'á` for nouny terminators)
	- Relation caps are: `[function]+<direction>`
	- Terminator caps are: `[function]+<animacy>`
	- Particle caps are: `[function]+<particle/rel2rel/term>`
	- `à` caps are: `[function]+<marking>`
	- `ì` caps are: `[function]+(<animacy> | i)`
4. Shortenings
	- Have a long word? shorten it by omitting clarifying information with `zò`, then capping it by restating the vowel (so for nouns use `á`) and the usual cap.
	- Examples:
		- `rāvòtipábábpi'ádi` can be shortened to `rāvòzò'ádi`
		- `míbàtišoŋōhnōxfosòvovòŋōfsozo'íbi` (roughly, the path the sun traces through the sky) shortens to `míbàtiŋōhzò'íbi`

\* for canonical poly-locus words, there may be a preferred order, though this is not grammatically mandatory.
