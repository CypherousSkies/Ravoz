## Glyphs
Glyphs are constructed around a tone-vowel pair, which determines the function domain of that root.

type | triangle (i) | circle (a) | irregular (o) 
-|-|-|-
particle ( )| curl-tri | 6 | V 
terminator (/) | 4 | o- | -c
relation (-) | A | /o\ | $\gamma$ˇ 
decorations (\\) | pronouns | numbers/domains | grouping

Their functions are:

type | i | a | o
-|-|-|-
. | [[i-Animacy & Certainty]] | [[a-Media]] | [[o-Adjectives & Conjugation]]
/ | [[í-States of Being]] | [[á-Nouns]] | [[ó-Questions & Unknowns]]
\- | [[ī-Reflexive Relations]] | [[ā-Collections]] | [[ō-Paths]]
\\ | [[ì-Pronouns]] | [[à-Domain Markers & Numbers]] | [[ò-Grouping]]

Their polysyllabic cartouches are formed as follows:

type | i | a | o
-|-|-|-
. | ? | ? | chained intersection
/ | )>- | @\_ | ?
\- | ? | ? | ?
\\ | o- or -\|> | n/a | n/a
I haven't had need of the ones marked `?` yet so I'll fill them in as is useful

### Parts of Speech
These categories bare some explaining so lets pick them apart:
- **Terminators**: These are intransitive verbs and nouns, things which (generally) form the beginning or end of a sentence.
- **Relations**: These (as the name suggests) are verbs which form a relation between two (or more) loci (so things like "A loves B")
	- As a note the irregular relation is called a **path**, which while not entirely its own grammatical category, is interesting in its own right. It may function as a relation (depicting change from something to something else) or a kind of special terminator (placing something within a range).
- **Particles**: In addition to serving as grammatical modifiers (conjugation, clarifying medium, & kind), they may serve as terminators or relations to relations (e.g. how "liked that" in "I liked that she grabbed flowers" forms a relation between "I" and "grabbed")
- **Decorations**: Grammatically, decorations are much like relations, just far less regular.
	- `ì` syllables are pronouns (which are rarely written) which serve as placeholder connections in linear or complex texts (in practice they are a special kind of relation which function like terminators)
	- `à` syllables are numbers and domain markers, which are written above or below a line to give more information (in practice a kind of particle which cannot serve as a terminator)
	- `ò` syllables are grouping words (including prepositions, parentheses, and [[#Cartouches]]) with a various ways of being written
### Consonant Markings
[[#Unmarked Glyphs|Usually]], a glyph will need a consonant marking before becoming meaningful. As a result we have a bunch of markings to decorate glyphs, thus imparting meaning. These markings are featural, but because rendering images in a table is hard, I'll leave it to the reader to group the consonant markings on an IPA table (for some help, refer to [[Phonology#Consonants]]).
While order is not terribly important, I am limited to linear lists when writing in english, so I will present the consonants in a cannonical order (which then form [[#Vowel Stories]]):

### Unmarked Glyphs
If, however, a glyph is not marked it may take on a new meaning, usually following what the glyph already stands for:
type | triangle | circle | irregular
-|-|-|-
particle | ambiguous animacy\* | natural medium | naturally/now
term | exists | generic thing | question
relation | is/becomes | and/or | natural journey/comparison

It should be noted that as the decorations can't really avoid being marked, and so are omitted from this table.

There are many reasons to leave a glyph unmarked (especially for `ā` which is vital to managing the flow of complex graphs), so don't be shy to use them!

\* Almost always at most person. For ambiguous but sometimes enigmatic, use ti or ti'i unless it's clear from context/name that the entity in question is sometimes enigmatic.
