# Phonology
## Vowels
There are 3 vowels — `a`, `i`, `o` — and three tones — rising (first, `á`), constant (second, `ā`), falling (third, `à`), and no tone (zeroth, unstressed, `a` or `ȧ`). They can be written as either vowel-number (e.g. `a1` meaning /a/ with rising tone, with `a` meaning /a/ with no tone) or with their pinyin equivalents (e.g. `á` meaning /a/ with rising tone, `ȧ` or `a` for no tone).
All vowel-tone pairs are represented by [[#Glyphs]] (unit of written information) and is modified by at least one consonant. In general, changing tone corresponds to terminators, constant tone to relations, and no tone to particles.
Additionally, in transliteration it is also acceptable to write in the direction of the changing tones with acute and grave markings, though this has makes no semantic difference (except perhaps as a meta-textual spoken-only way to emphasize a reversal of time).

## Consonants
\- | labial |  coronal | retroflex |  velar 
-|-|-|-|-
plosive| `p`/p/ `b`/b/ | `t`/t/ `d`/d/ |  | `k`/k/ `g`/g/ 
nasal| `m`/m/ |  `n`/n/ | | `ŋ`/ŋ/
fricative| `f`/f/ `v`/v/ | `s`/s/ `z`/z/ | `š`/ʂ/ `ž`/ʐ/ | `h`/x/ `x`/ɣ/ 
approximants| | `r`/r,ɾ/ `l` /l/ | `ř`/ɻ/ | 

Consonants are [[Writing#Consonant Markings|written]] as modifying a vowel (which should make sense, as the vowel determines the function of a root). 

### Consonant Groupings
Some consonants sound similar and so have clustered meanings:
nasals: `m n ŋ`
stops: `b d p t`
fricatives: `s f š ž v z`
approx: `r l ř`
velar: `g k h x`

## Phonotactics
Rules!
1. Syllables are (C)(C)V(C)
2. Dipthongs are allowed but only as shortenings
	1. If two vowels are next to each other and their distinction is desired, are pronounced separately and written as V`'`V.
	2. Otherwise say VV.
		1. If one of the vowels is non-tonal, say the dipthong with the tone of the tonal one
3. a voiced consonant cannot occur next to its unvoiced pair and vice versa (e.g. no `pb`)
4. Something something sonority hierarchy for onset
	1. a>e>i>[r ř l]>[m n ŋ]>[v z ž x]>[f s š h]>[b d g]>[p t k]
5. rules for replacing illegal strings with legal ones
